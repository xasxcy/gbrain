    console.log(`Usage: gbrain sync [options]

Sync the brain repo's text content into the engine, then embed.

Options:
  --no-embed           Skip the embed step. Use this when the embed
                       provider is misconfigured or you want to defer
                       embedding (run 'gbrain embed --stale' later).
  --no-extract         Skip the link/timeline extraction step. Pages will
                       show as stale in 'gbrain doctor'; run
                       'gbrain extract --stale' later to catch up.
  --workers N          Run the import phase with N parallel workers
                       (alias: --concurrency). Default: 4 when the
                       diff is >100 files, else serial.
  --source <id>        Scope sync to a single source. Defaults to the
                       brain's default source.
  --repo <path>        Path to the brain repo. Defaults to the path
                       saved by 'gbrain init'.
  --full               Force a full re-sync (rare; usually incremental).
  --src-subpath <dir>  Sync only this subdirectory of the git repo (monorepo
                       pattern: N logical sources in one repo). Git pull/diff
                       run at the repo root; imports are scoped to the subdir
                       and slugs stay root-relative (wiki/page1). Passing the
                       subdirectory directly as --repo also works.
  --exclude <glob>     Exclude files matching the glob from sync (repeatable;
                       matched against the scope-relative path).
  --include-gitignored Include otherwise-syncable files matched by .gitignore.
                       Forces a full filesystem walk so periodic syncs see
                       ignored untracked content.
  --working-tree       Also import uncommitted working-tree state (untracked
                       files + uncommitted edits/deletes). Default: committed
                       changes only — uncommitted drift is counted and warned,
                       never silently ignored. Persist with
                       'gbrain config set sync.include_working_tree true'.
                       Caution: imports untracked files as-is — unignored
                       scratch files and secrets included; review 'git status'
                       before enabling, especially as persisted config.
  --dry-run            Show what would be synced without writing.
  --skip-failed        Acknowledge previously-recorded sync failures so
                       the bookmark can advance past unparseable files.
  --retry-failed       Re-attempt previously-failed files; clear on success.
  --watch              Re-sync continuously on an interval.
  --interval N         Watch-mode interval in seconds (default 60).
  --no-pull            Skip 'git pull' before the sync (useful for tests).
  --no-delegate        On a PGLite brain with a live 'gbrain serve', sync
                       normally delegates the run to the serve process over
                       its IPC socket (the lock owner does the work; embeds
                       defer to serve's background sweep). This flag (or
                       GBRAIN_SYNC_NO_DELEGATE=1) opts out — sync then fails
                       fast if a live serve holds the brain.
  --no-schema-pack     Skip loading the active schema pack (no per-file pack
                       regex runs; pages use legacy prefix typing). Escape
                       hatch if a suspect pack regex is wedging sync.
                       GBRAIN_SYNC_TRACE=1 names the file being imported (hang triage).
  --all                Sync every registered source instead of just the
                       default (multi-source brains).
  --parallel N         (with --all) Run up to N sources concurrently.
                       Default: min(sourceCount, --workers, 4). Each
                       source takes its own per-source DB lock
                       (gbrain-sync:<source_id>) so independent sources
                       sync without contending. Total live Postgres
                       connections per wave ≈ parallel × workers × 2
                       (per-file pool) + parent pool. Pass --parallel 1
                       to force serial.
  --missing-path M     (with --all) What to do when a source's local_path
                       does not exist on this machine: 'fail' (default —
                       loud, current behavior) or 'skip' (classify as
                       skipped_missing_path: ⊘ in the aggregate, excluded
                       from error_count and the rc=1 gate). Use skip on
                       brains whose sources were registered from more
                       than one machine.
  --json               Emit a structured JSON envelope on stdout
                       ({schema_version: 1, sources, parallel,
                       ok_count, error_count, skipped_count}). Sources
                       skipped by --missing-path skip appear with
                       status 'skipped_missing_path' and their
                       local_path. Human banners route to stderr so
                       '--json | jq' parses cleanly.
                       Exit codes: 0 = all sources ok or skipped,
                       1 = any error, 2 = cost-prompt-not-confirmed.
  --yes                Accept any interactive prompts (CI / non-TTY).

 *      stdout JSON-only (D4).
 *
 * Note: source.name is shown in the start banner (one-shot, easy to
 * escape) but the prefix on every line uses source.id (slug-validated;
 * no newline-injection risk per D13).
 *
 * The per-source DB lock invariant (D8) fires inside `performSync` —
