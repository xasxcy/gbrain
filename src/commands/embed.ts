/**
 * Chunkless-page safety net for `embed --stale`. `listStaleChunks` /
 * `countStaleChunks` only ever look at `content_chunks` rows where
 * `embedding IS NULL` — a page written directly via `putPage` that never
 * went through chunking (e.g. an enrichment-generated entity stub) has NO
 * chunk row at all, so it is invisible to that scan forever, even after
 * unlimited `embed --stale` runs.
 *
 * This sweep finds pages with non-empty content (`compiled_truth` and/or
 * `timeline` — both are chunked independently, mirroring `embedPage`'s
 * chunkless branch) and zero `content_chunks` rows
 * (`engine.listChunklessPagesWithContent`, which already excludes
 * quarantined + embed_skip pages — both intentionally chunkless). The new
 * chunk rows land with `embedding = NULL`, so they flow into the SAME
 * `embed --stale` pass via the existing cursor below — no separate embed
 * step needed here.
 *
 * dryRun chunks locally (a pure, in-memory operation) to report an
 * accurate count without writing anything, matching embedPage's dry-run
 * contract (including `pages_processed`, which embedPage's own dry-run
 * branch increments for exactly this "examined, didn't write" case).
 *
 * Race note (review catch, three rounds — ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK, not
 * fully closed): between listing a page and writing its chunks, a
 * concurrent writer (sync, another `put_page`) could change or chunk the
 * SAME page. Two mitigations, both bounded — full atomicity (a
 * transaction/version-guarded conditional write inside `upsertChunks`)
 * would need a new engine primitive shared by every `upsertChunks` caller,
 * which is out of scope for a chunkless-page safety net:
 *   1. Immediately before writing, re-fetch the LIVE page via `getPage`
 *      and build `inputs` from ITS CURRENT content, not the batch-list
 *      snapshot — closes the "content changed but still chunkless"
 *      sub-case, not just the "chunks appeared" one.
 *   2. Re-check `getChunks` right after that same fetch — skip (don't
 *      overwrite) if chunks now exist AT THE TIME OF THE CHECK.
 * What this does NOT close: a writer that inserts chunks in the gap
 * BETWEEN step 2's check and the `upsertChunks` call immediately below it
 * (no intervening `await` other than that one call, but `upsertChunks`
 * itself is not conditioned on the check — this is still check-then-write,
 * not compare-and-swap) can still have its chunks overwritten — HONESTLY:
 * `upsertChunks` treats its input as the full desired chunk set for that
 * page and deletes any existing chunk_index absent from it, so a
 * concurrent writer's chunks landing in that exact gap CAN be replaced
 * with this sweep's stale-content chunks (embedding NULL). This is the
 * SAME check-then-write window `embedPage`'s existing single-page
 * chunkless branch already ships with today (that branch doesn't even
 * have step 2's re-check) — no new race CLASS is introduced, and the
 * window here is a single sequential getPage+getChunks+upsertChunks
 * instead of spanning a whole batch. The blast radius is bounded: the
 * page is NOT deleted or corrupted, just re-chunked from a stale
 * snapshot, and the NEXT write to that page (sync, another edit) that
 * actually chunks it restores correct content — this sweep's own
 * predicate is idempotent and doesn't compound the drift. Closing this
 * fully (true atomicity) is tracked as a follow-up, not blocking this
 * safety net.
 *
 * Per-page failure isolation (review catch): one malformed/oversized
 * chunkless page must not abort the sweep and, with it, the entire
 * `--stale` run before the normal NULL-embedding pass even starts — that
 * would make the safety net WORSE than the bug it fixes. Each page's
 * work is try/caught; a failure is recorded (`EmbedResult.failures` +
 * `failure_samples`, same convention as every other embed failure path)
 * and the sweep moves on.
 *
 * Bounded, keyset-paginated (like listStalePagesForExtraction) — a safety
 * net for a rare drift case, not the primary bulk-chunking path. `BATCH_SIZE`
 * is deliberately small (unlike the 2000-chunk-row default elsewhere in
 * this file): each row here carries a FULL page body (`compiled_truth` +
 * `timeline`), so a large batch of large pages is a real memory/latency
 * concern the metadata-only `listStaleChunks` rows never had (review
 * catch). It still respects the caller's pacer (no-op when pacing is off)
 * and a soft wall-clock cap (`GBRAIN_EMBED_TIME_BUDGET_MS`) so a
 * pathologically large damaged brain can't run this sweep unbounded — it
 * heals what it can and reports the rest for the next `embed --stale` run
 * (the SQL predicate is idempotent; nothing here requires finishing in one
 * pass). `startedAt` is shared with the caller's overall run clock (review
 * catch) — healing and the main stale loop draw from ONE combined budget
 * window, not two independent 30-minute ones. `catchUp` mirrors the main
 * loop's own `--catch-up` handling: removes the cap entirely (the keyset
 * cursor still terminates on its own; `signal` remains the abort path).

 * v0.33.3: rate-limit-aware embedBatch wrapper.
 *
 * The OpenAI SDK has built-in retry with exponential backoff, but its
 * backoff window (max ~4s) is too short for TPM (tokens-per-minute)
 * rate limits on large pages (~90K tokens).  This wrapper catches
 * 429-shaped errors, parses the retry delay from the error message
 * (e.g. "Please try again in 248ms"), and sleeps before retrying.
 *
 * v0.33.4 hardening (codex + re-review findings):
 *   - D4: detect 429 via the wrapped error's `cause.status` (the gateway's
 *     normalizeAIError stores the original error there). Bare `e.status`
 *     never fires against an `AITransientError` wrap. Message-match stays
 *     as a fallback.
 *   - D4a: pass `maxRetries: 0` through `embedBatch` so the AI SDK's
 *     default 2-retry stack doesn't multiply this wrapper's 5 attempts.
 *   - D2: jitter the parsed delay ±30% so 20 concurrent workers don't
 *     resynchronize on the next 429 wave.
 *   - D3a/D8: when an external AbortSignal fires (wall-clock budget), the
 *     sleep wakes up early AND the abortSignal is threaded into the gateway
 *     embed call so an in-flight HTTP request cancels too.
 *
 * Up to MAX_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES attempts with the parsed (jittered) delay
 * (or a 60s fallback when the message can't be parsed).

/**
 * #3037: embed one page's chunk texts with per-chunk failure isolation.
 *
 * All three embed paths used to send a page's chunks in ONE
 * embedBatch call, so one bad chunk (e.g. an oversized chunk the provider
 * 400s) left EVERY sibling chunk NULL — an ~8.6x blast radius. This wrapper
 * tries the batch first (the cheap, common path), and only on a
 * PERMANENT-looking batch failure retries once per chunk so one bad chunk
 * costs one chunk.
 *
 * Cost bounding — when we do NOT fan out (rethrow instead):
 *   - 429 / rate limit: embedBatchWithBackoff already retried with backoff;
 *     fanning out N single-chunk calls would hammer the same limiter N-fold.
 *   - AITransientError (5xx / network / unknown, per normalizeAIError): the
 *     batch CONTENT isn't the problem, so isolation can't help — during an
 *     outage it would just multiply failing calls per page.
 *   - 401/403 (auth): nothing chunk-specific; every call would fail.
 * When we DO fan out (permanent request-shaped 4xx like 400/413/422), the
 * per-chunk pass happens at most ONCE per page per run and re-spends roughly
 * the same tokens the failed batch would have — bounded, no recursion. A
 * fresh 429 arising DURING the fan-out still gets the normal backoff (each
 * single-chunk call goes through embedBatchWithBackoff).
 *
 * Throws when nothing could be embedded (total failure — same contract as
 * the pre-#3037 single batch call). Returns `null` at the index of each
 * failed chunk otherwise.
