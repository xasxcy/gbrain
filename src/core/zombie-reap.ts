/**
 * Reap zombie child processes.
 *
 * Bun (like Node) only auto-reaps child processes when a SIGCHLD handler is
 * installed. Without this, child processes spawned by the worker (embed
 * batches, shell jobs, sub-agents) become zombies when they exit,
 * accumulating in the PID table and (in the original production cascade)
 * holding phantom DB connection slots.
 *
 * A no-op handler is sufficient — the runtime calls waitpid() internally as
 * long as a listener is registered. EventEmitter does NOT dedupe listeners by
 * reference; the includes() check below is what prevents duplicate listeners
 * across hot-import scenarios (test harnesses re-importing modules in the
 * same process).
