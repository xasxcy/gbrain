// v0.40.6.0 Schema Cathedral v3 — best-effort active pack loader.
//
// Single source of truth for the T1.5 wiring sites (whoknows,
// find-experts, facts/eligibility, enrichment-service). All four call
// sites consume this helper so the empty-filter fallback contract lives
// in ONE place. Without this helper, the four sites would each open-code
// their own `try { load pack } catch { ... }` block, and one of them
// WILL drift to silently use hardcoded defaults — the bug class D4
// closed.
//
// Contract (D4 from /plan-eng-review):
//   - Pack load succeeds → return the ResolvedPack.
//   - Pack load fails (any reason: corrupt file, missing pack, federation
//     divergence, trust-gate reject) → return null.
//   - Caller MUST interpret null as "EMPTY FILTER" semantics. A null
//     return is NOT a license to fall back to hardcoded defaults like
//     ['person', 'company']; that silently re-introduces types the
//     user packed out.
//
// The empty-filter contract is the load-bearing design choice. Pack-load
// failure should be loud (query returns empty results, agent debugs the
// pack-load problem) — not silent (results look normal but contradict
// user intent).

/**
 * Best-effort loader for the active schema pack. Returns null on any

 *
 * NEVER throws. Never logs to stderr (callers don't need the noise on
 * routine queries; the underlying pack-load errors surface through
 * `gbrain doctor`'s schema_pack_coverage / schema_pack_writability
 * checks).
 *
 * @example
 *   // In whoknows.ts (T1.5 wiring site):
 *   const pack = await loadActivePackBestEffort(ctx);
 *   const types = pack
 *     ? expertTypesFromPack(pack)
 *     : [];  // EMPTY filter, NOT hardcoded defaults
 *   const results = await search(query, { types });

/**
 * Resolve the active pack for a LOCAL, engine-backed surface.
 *
 * Prefer this over `loadActivePackBestEffort` anywhere you hold a live engine
 * and are running locally. It differs in the two ways that bite such callers:
 *
 *   - **`remote: false`.** `loadActivePackBestEffort` defaults
 *     `remote: ctx.remote ?? true`, so a caller that has no real
 *     OperationContext (and passes something like `{ engine } as never`)
 *     silently runs under REMOTE trust gating. A tier-1 trust rejection then
 *     returns null — indistinguishable from "there is no pack".
 *   - **DB-side pack visibility.** Reads the engine's `schema_pack` config key
 *     and pairs it with FILE-ONLY config, so a post-unify DB-side pack flip is
 *     visible. Full `loadConfig()` merges transient env/database state and can
 *     resolve a DIFFERENT pack than the onboard checks do — which is how a
 *     recommender and its handler end up disagreeing about the same brain.
 *
 * Same null contract as `loadActivePackBestEffort` (D4): null means the pack
 * could not be resolved and is NOT a license to fall back to hardcoded
 * defaults. Callers acting on a *capability* question must additionally
 * surface null DISTINCTLY from "resolved, but lacks the capability" —
 * collapsing the two converts a loud failure into a silent one.
 *
 * Does not thread tier-3 `sourceId`: the callers here ask a brain-wide
 * question, and the previous `{ engine } as never` shape passed no sourceId
 * either, so this is behavior-neutral on that tier.
