/**
 * Process-cleanup registry.
 *
 * v0.41.6.0 D5 — registry + signal handlers so abnormal termination
 * (SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGPIPE, EPIPE on stdout, uncaughtException) releases
 * locks instead of leaking them for up to 30 minutes until the TTL
 * expires. Pre-v0.41.6.0, a full `gbrain sync` piped into `head` would
 * SIGPIPE gbrain, finally blocks wouldn't run, and the next sync would report
 * "Another sync is in progress" because the lock row was orphaned.
 *
 * (The flag name is spelled out rather than written literally: the CLI
 * flag-registry generator scans comments, so a bare double-dash token here
 * would be inherited as an accepted flag by every command that imports this
 * module. Pinned by `test/cli-flag-validation.test.ts`.)
 *
 * Design (per eng-review D7 + outside-voice F9-F11, 2026-05-24):
 *
 *  - SIGTERM/SIGHUP are cooperative: abort registered work units, wait up to
 *    30s for their drains, then release locks. SIGPIPE, uncaughtException,
 *    and unhandledRejection retain the fast cleanup path. **NOT SIGINT** —
 *    gbrain has an existing
 *    SIGINT-via-AbortController path in cli.ts that propagates
 *    abort to in-flight operations (clean cancel). Installing cleanup
 *    on SIGINT here would preempt that flow. Lock release on user
 *    cancel belongs in the AbortController path, not in a parallel
 *    signal handler.
 *
 *  - Idempotent: a second signal during the cleanup pass is a NO-OP.
 *    First pass runs to its 3s deadline; users who want a forced exit
 *    can SIGKILL.
 *
 *  - Single ownership: `tryAcquireDbLock` auto-registers; the returned
 *    handle's `release()` deregisters. `withRefreshingLock` just
 *    consumes the handle as a normal caller (it calls tryAcquireDbLock
 *    internally, so the registration happens there). No double-register.
 *
 *  - Best-effort: cleanup callbacks run via Promise.allSettled with a
 *    3s deadline after any cooperative drain. Throws don't block other
 *    callbacks. Engine pool already closed → DELETE fails silently → process
 *    exits anyway.
 *
 *  - Normal exit path unchanged: try/finally in `tryAcquireDbLock` and
 *    `withRefreshingLock` already releases on normal completion;
 *    deregister-before-release is atomic in single-threaded JS so no
 *    double-DELETE.
