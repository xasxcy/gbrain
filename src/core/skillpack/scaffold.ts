/**
 * skillpack/scaffold.ts — `gbrain skillpack scaffold <name>`.
 *
 * One-time, additive copy of a bundled skill into a host workspace. The
 * file-copy primitive is shared with harvest (host→gbrain) via
 * `copyArtifacts`. The bundle enumeration is shared with the bundle
 * manifest itself via `enumerateScaffoldEntries` — which now also picks
 * up paired source files declared in each skill's frontmatter
 * `sources:` array.
 *
 * Contracts (the new model):
 *   1. **No managed-block writes.** The host's RESOLVER.md / AGENTS.md
 *      stays untouched. Routing happens via each skill's frontmatter
 *      `triggers:` array, which downstream agents walk at runtime.
 *   2. **Refuses to overwrite existing files.** Once a file lands, the
 *      user owns it. To update, run `gbrain skillpack reference <name>`
 *      and decide.
 *   3. **Partial-state policy.** When `skills/<slug>/` already exists
 *      but the skill's frontmatter declares paired `sources:` that are
 *      missing on host, scaffold copies the missing paired files into
 *      place. Existing files are still preserved. Closes the
 *      "skill shipped, later gained a paired source" gap.
 *   4. **No lockfile, no cumulative-slugs receipt, no `--all` prune.**
 *      All deleted. The new model lets the user own the files; nothing
 *      to lock or to track.
