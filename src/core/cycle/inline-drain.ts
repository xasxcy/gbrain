/**
 * Inline drain for the dream cycle's private per-run child queues (peeled from
 * synthesize.ts; #4194 adds bounded concurrency).
 *
 * Why inline on BOTH engines:
 *   - PGLite: no separate Minions worker can run at all (the embedded
 *     data-dir holds an exclusive file lock), so children would sit in
 *     'waiting' until waitForCompletion times out.
 *   - Postgres (#2050): the parent phase itself runs as a job inside a
 *     `jobs work` process. A worker whose slots are all occupied by such
 *     parents can never claim the child the parent is blocking on — a
 *     structural self-deadlock. Running children inline means a child never
 *     needs a worker slot.
 *
 * Concurrency model (#4194): N independent `drainLoop`s share the queue via
 * the same SKIP-LOCKED `queue.claim` fencing workers use at concurrency N.
 * Everything job-scoped (lockToken, abort, timeout timer, keepalive,
 * renewTimer, outcome recording) is loop-local. Pool hygiene:
 *   - Housekeeping sweeps (handleStalled/handleTimeouts/handleWallClock) are
 *     LEADER-ONLY (loop 0) — they're global, idempotent SQL and N copies per
 *     iteration would add pooler load on exactly the deployments #4194 is
 *     about. `promoteDelayed` runs in EVERY loop: it is the cheap sweep that
 *     picks up 0-delay retries, and any surviving loop must be able to do it
 *     (the leader may have exited on an empty queue while a sibling's child
 *     was still running and later failed to 'delayed').
 *   - A NON-RETRYABLE loop-level failure aborts sibling loops after their
 *     current child (shared poolAbort). A child failure is NOT a loop failure
 *     — one failing child never blocks siblings (#4194 acceptance).
 *   - Provider ceilings stay with the rate leases: the handler's lease
 *     acquisition (legacy per-turn, gateway per-turn hook, oneshot per-call)
 *     is the API limiter; a lease-full child requeues WITHOUT burning an
 *     attempt (worker parity), so inline concurrency above the lease cap
 *     degrades to waiting, never to dead-letters.
