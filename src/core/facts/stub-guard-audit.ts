/**
 * Stub-guard audit log. JSONL, ISO-week-rotated, best-effort.
 *
 * Writes one line per stub-guard fire to
 *   `${GBRAIN_AUDIT_DIR:-~/.gbrain/audit}/stub-guard-YYYY-Www.jsonl`
 * when `writeFactsToFence` refuses to spawn an unprefixed entity page
 * (reason 'unprefixed') or a page for a fallback-resolved slug (#4108,
 * reason 'fallback_resolution'). The audit log is the operator visibility
 * surface for the v0.34.5+ stub guard sunset criterion, WHICH APPLIES TO
 * THE 'unprefixed' REASON ONLY: when unprefixed reads <5 hits/week for 3
 * consecutive weeks on production brains, that arm can be removed in v0.36
 * (the prefix expansion in resolveEntitySlug is sufficient). The
 * 'fallback_resolution' arm never sunsets — it is the only wall between
 * resolver-invented slugs and canonical page creation.
 *
 * Best-effort: write failures go to stderr and never block the legacy DB-only
 * fallback path. A disk-full attacker could silently disable the trail.
 *
 * Reader pattern (READ THIS):
 *
 * `readRecentStubGuardEvents({ sinceMs: 24h })` reads BOTH the current AND
 * the previous ISO-week file before filtering by `ts >= now - sinceMs`.
 * The DELIBERATE divergence from `supervisor-audit.ts:readSupervisorEvents`
 * is the whole reason this module exists separately: that reader reads only
 * the current week file, which loses 24h-window correctness across Monday
 * 00:00 UTC (a Sunday 23:55 event is in last week's file). When the doctor's
 * 24h check runs on Monday 00:01 UTC against a brain that fired the guard
 * Sunday at 23:55, the supervisor pattern would silently miss it. The
 * 2-file read costs nothing (cheap fs read; misses are still cheap when
 * the file doesn't exist) and makes the window correct.
 *
 * Follow-up TODO (filed separately, not in this PR): fix
 * `readSupervisorEvents` to use the same 2-file pattern.
