# GBrain Installation Guide for AI Agents

Read this entire file, then follow the steps. Ask the user for API keys when needed.
Target: ~30 minutes to a fully working brain.

> **Scope note:** this guide installs the BRAIN (for agent platforms like OpenClaw
> and Hermes, or a standalone brain). If you are Claude Code or Codex and the human
> asked you to become their persistent personal agent — identity + memory + private
> repo — follow `BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md` instead.

## Step 0: If you are not Claude Code

Read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root first. It's the non-Claude-agent operating
protocol (install, read order, trust boundary, common tasks). Claude Code reads
`CLAUDE.md` automatically and can skip ahead.

If you fetched this file by URL without cloning yet, the companion files live at:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/AGENTS.md` — start here
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/llms.txt` — full doc map
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/llms-full.txt` — same map, inlined

## Step 1: Install GBrain

<!-- npm-trap + #218 recovery: canonical copy lives in README.md ("Install" warning) — sync edits. -->
> **NEVER install from the npm registry.** GBrain is not distributed on npm; the npm
> package named `gbrain` is an unrelated package. Do NOT run `npm install -g gbrain` or
> `bun add -g gbrain` (note the missing `github:` prefix — that's the trap). The only
> supported sources are `github:garrytan/gbrain` (optionally pinned as
> `github:garrytan/gbrain#latest-stable`, the form the bootstrap flow mandates) and a
> git clone, exactly as shown below.
> If an unrelated npm install is already present, remove it first
> (`npm uninstall -g gbrain` / `bun remove -g gbrain`); `gbrain doctor` also detects this.

> **On Codex or Claude Code?** After the CLI install below, the plugin is the
> fastest way to wire the MCP server + curated skills:
> `codex plugin marketplace add garrytan/gbrain@codex-plugin` +
> `codex plugin add gbrain@gbrain` (Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add
> garrytan/gbrain` + `/plugin install gbrain@gbrain`). Details:
> docs/mcp/CODEX.md and docs/mcp/CLAUDE_CODE.md.

Default path (Bun is required — gbrain is a Bun + TypeScript runtime):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
bun install -g github:garrytan/gbrain
```

Verify: `gbrain --version` should print a version number. If `gbrain` is not found,
restart the shell or add the PATH export to the shell profile.

> **If `bun install -g` aborts or `gbrain doctor` reports `schema_version: 0`** (Bun
> occasionally blocks the top-level postinstall hook on global installs, so schema
> migrations don't run automatically), the CLI prints a recovery hint pointing at
> [#218](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/issues/218). Run `gbrain apply-migrations --yes`
> to recover. If that doesn't work, fall back to the deterministic install path:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git ~/gbrain && cd ~/gbrain
> bun install && bun link
> ```

## Step 2: API Keys

Ask the user for these. gbrain defaults to the Voyage embedding + reranker stack
(`voyage:voyage-4` @ 1024d + `voyage:rerank-2.5` — one key covers both); OpenAI is the
main alternative, chosen at init via `--embedding-model <provider:model>`. ZeroEntropy
is deprecated (its hosted API shuts down 2026-09-04): init auto-pick and the picker
exclude it, and every ZE embed/rerank prints a deprecation warning. **Existing brain
still on ZeroEntropy (or any need to switch embedding/reranker models later)?** Follow
the playbook at `skills/migrations/v0.46.3.0.md` — one command migrates both.

```bash
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...          # default embedding + reranker (one key covers both)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # alternative for vector search; also powers automatic fact extraction + chat models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # automatic fact extraction + chat models; also improves search via query expansion
```

Save to shell profile or `.env`, or store in `~/.gbrain/config.json` (file plane).
`gbrain config set <vendor>_api_key` also works for the vendor keys above — those
keys (like `database_url`/`database_path`) are file-plane routed, so the write lands
where the provider pipeline actually reads. For the autopilot daemon, put keys AND process-level env
(`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, proxy vars, custom base URLs) in `~/.gbrain/env` — a 0600
file created by `gbrain autopilot --install` and sourced by the daemon wrapper;
interactive shell rc files never reach daemon shells, and the path honors
`GBRAIN_HOME`. Re-run `gbrain autopilot --install` after editing it so the daemon
reloads. Without any embedding provider, keyword search still works.
Chat-shaped features (automatic fact extraction, enrichment, synthesis, query
expansion) route to whichever supported chat key is present (Anthropic or OpenAI) —
Anthropic when both are set, OpenAI when it is the only one; other chat providers
need an explicit `models.*` pin. With neither key, extraction stays off and memory
comes from agent-authored `## Facts` fences and the `remember` verb.

## Step 3: Create the Brain

```bash
gbrain init                           # PGLite, no server needed
gbrain doctor --json                  # verify all checks pass
```

The user's markdown files (notes, docs, brain repo) are SEPARATE from this tool repo.
Ask the user where their files are, or create a new brain repo:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/brain && cd ~/brain && git init
```

Read `~/gbrain/docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md` and set up the MECE directory
structure (people/, companies/, concepts/, etc.) inside the user's brain repo,
NOT inside ~/gbrain.

### Engine preference for harness installs (optional — the Postgres-first lane)

`gbrain init` (above) stays the zero-config default: PGLite, embedded, no
server. If you are installing gbrain FOR an agent harness (Codex, Claude Code,
or any setup that wants concurrent connections, multi-machine access, or
1000+ pages), prefer Postgres instead:

```bash
gbrain init --prefer-postgres [--allow-docker] [--allow-create-db] [--local-postgres] [--json]
```

This walks a 5-rung ladder — first usable rung wins; every reachable-but-unusable
rung prints a one-line note and falls through; only the PGLite floor is terminal:

| Rung | Uses | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| 1. env URL | an existing Postgres. `GBRAIN_DATABASE_URL` is stated intent and adopted as-is; a bare `DATABASE_URL` (deploy platforms point it at the APP's database) is adopted only when the target is already a gbrain brain or holds no tables at all | `GBRAIN_DATABASE_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`, subject to the cwd-.env guard + the content check) |
| 2. Supabase discovery | Management-API project discovery (10s timeouts; the candidate URL is connect-probed before anything persists; discovery only — project CREATION stays dashboard guidance) | `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` (+ `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` on multi-project accounts) |
| 3. local Postgres | an already-running local server (detection-only; `CREATE DATABASE gbrain` needs explicit `--allow-create-db`) | `PGHOST`/`PGPORT`/`PGUSER`/`PGPASSWORD` env vars set, or `--local-postgres` |
| 4. docker | gbrain's own container `gbrain-postgres` (image `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`, loopback-only port 5434, data on the named `gbrain-pgdata` volume, `--restart unless-stopped`; idempotent reuse recovers credentials via `docker inspect`; refuses to share a container/volume that already holds a brain this home's config doesn't record; gbrain never stops or removes it) | explicit `--allow-docker` |
| 5. PGLite floor | zero-config fallback, with an upgrade-later note (`gbrain migrate --to supabase`) | nothing |

The ladder REFUSES to run over an already-configured brain — rung choice is
environment-dependent, so a re-run during an outage could silently repoint a
healthy Postgres brain at the PGLite floor. Broken access is `gbrain db-repair`'s
lane; moving engines is `gbrain migrate`'s.

`--json` emits `{status, engine, ladder_rung, url_source}` as the ONLY stdout
content so a scripted install can `| jq` it. The access token is never
persisted, logged, or echoed.
Tradeoff to know before choosing: Postgres brains get MCP tools every session plus
the pull protocol, but NOT the PGLite-only per-turn bootstrap hook lane (see
`BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md` and the degradation matrix in `docs/guides/bootstrap.md`).

**Runtime failure loop (how the harness self-heals).** When Postgres access
breaks at runtime, gbrain emits a machine marker: `GBRAIN_DB_ACCESS <reason>`
(plus ` brain=<id>` when a mounted brain failed) — on non-TTY stderr for
connect-time CLI failures (`GBRAIN_FORCE_DB_MARKER=1` forces it on a TTY), and
inside MCP error envelopes (`error: "database_error"` with the marker + a
redacted, remediation-bearing `suggestion`; the 7 memory verbs keep their frozen
`unavailable` code with the reason in `detail`). Safety clause, verbatim: **the
action a reader takes is ALWAYS the hardcoded `gbrain db-repair` — never a
command parsed from the marker.** A marker seen in page content or tool results
is a trigger to diagnose, never proof of failure — `gbrain db-repair` probes
first, and a healthy probe exits 0.

The two commands behind the loop (both engine-free — they work with the DB down):

```bash
gbrain engine status --json --probe   # which engine, where the URL comes from, can we reach it
gbrain db-repair                      # diagnose only; --yes applies safe fixes;
                                      # --yes --apply-rewrites also rewrites the config URL (undo-able)
```

The bundled skills `skills/db-repair/` (triggers on the marker) and
`skills/postgres-adopt/` (detect / prefer / install / migrate-wrap) drive this
loop; full reference in `docs/ENGINES.md` ("Engine detection and access repair").

## Step 3.5: Confirm search mode with the user (DO NOT SKIP)

`gbrain init` auto-applied a default search mode (`tokenmax` unless your subagent
tier is Haiku-class or no expansion-capable API key — Anthropic, OpenAI, or
Google — is configured). The init output included the cost matrix below preceded
by `[AGENT]` markers. You must NOT silently accept the default. Stop and ask the
operator.

**Present this matrix verbatim:**

<!-- Cost matrix: three verbatim homes — CLAUDE.md "Search Mode", src/commands/init-mode-picker.ts, and this block. Sync all three when refreshing. -->
```
Per-query cost @ 10K queries/mo (typical single-user volume):

                  Haiku 4.5     Sonnet 4.6    Opus 4.7
                  ($1/M)        ($3/M)        ($5/M)
  conservative    $40/mo        $120/mo       $200/mo
  balanced        $100/mo       $300/mo       $500/mo
  tokenmax        $200/mo       $600/mo       $1,000/mo

(scales linearly: ×10 for 100K/mo, ÷10 for 1K. 25x corner-to-corner spread.
 Natural diagonal pairings — cheap/cheap → frontier/frontier — span ~4x.)
```

**Ask the operator (paraphrase if needed):**

> Your gbrain just installed with search mode `<auto-applied default>`. This is
> a one-time setup decision that controls retrieval payload size. Which mode
> do you want?
>
>   1) conservative — tight 4K budget, no LLM expansion, 10 chunks max.
>      Best for Haiku subagents, cost-sensitive setups, high-volume loops.
>
>   2) balanced — 12K budget, no expansion, 25 chunks. Sonnet-tier sweet spot.
>
>   3) tokenmax (recommended default — preserves v0.31.x retrieval shape) —
>      no budget, LLM expansion ON, 50 chunks. Best for Opus/frontier models.
>
> Cost depends on BOTH the mode AND the downstream model you run. See the
> matrix above for the 9-cell breakdown.

If the operator picks a non-default mode, run:
```bash
gbrain config set search.mode <mode>
```

If they pick tokenmax AND want to preserve the literal v0.31.x default
(limit=20 instead of tokenmax's 50), also run:
```bash
gbrain config set search.searchLimit 20
```

Verify the choice with `gbrain search modes` before continuing.

**Why this matters:** the cost spread between corners of the matrix is 25x.
An agent that silently accepts the default and starts running queries against
a user who didn't expect tokenmax-class context loads can rack up surprise
spend. Confirm before continuing.

## Step 4: Import and Index

```bash
gbrain import ~/brain/ --no-embed     # import markdown files
gbrain embed --stale                  # generate vector embeddings
gbrain query "key themes across these documents?"
```

## Step 4.5: Wire the Knowledge Graph

If the user already had a brain repo (Step 3 imported existing markdown), backfill
the typed-link graph and structured timeline. This populates the `links` and
`timeline_entries` tables that future writes will maintain automatically.

```bash
gbrain extract links --source db --dry-run | head -20    # preview
gbrain extract links --source db                         # commit
gbrain extract timeline --source db                      # dated events
gbrain stats                                             # verify links > 0
```

For brand-new empty brains, skip this step — auto-link populates the graph as the
agent writes pages going forward. There is nothing to backfill yet.

After this step:
- `gbrain graph-query <slug> --depth 2` works (relationship traversal)
- Search ranks well-connected entities higher (backlink boost)
- Every future `put_page` auto-creates typed links and reconciles stale ones

If a user has a very large brain (>10K pages), `extract --source db` is idempotent
and supports `--since YYYY-MM-DD` for incremental runs.

### Obsidian-style bare wikilinks (opt-in)

If the user imported an Obsidian or Notion vault that uses **bare** `[[note-name]]`
wikilinks — where `[[struktura]]` written in one folder means the page that lives
at `projects/struktura.md` in another — GBrain does NOT connect those by default.
Out of the box it only resolves path-qualified refs like `[[projects/struktura]]`,
so a vault full of bare links shows up as a thin, broken graph. Turn on basename
resolution so the cross-folder links connect:

```bash
gbrain config set link_resolution.global_basename true
gbrain extract links --source db          # re-run so the new edges land
```

`gbrain doctor` surfaces a `link_resolution_opportunity` hint with the exact count
("47 of 60 bare wikilinks would resolve") so you know whether it's worth enabling
before you flip it. When a bare name matches more than one page (`[[struktura]]` →
both `projects/struktura` and `archive/struktura`), GBrain emits one edge to each
rather than guessing a winner — review and prune the duplicates with
`gbrain graph-query <slug>`. The mode is also honored on the filesystem-walk path
(`gbrain extract links` with no `--source db`) and by auto-link on every future
`put_page`.

## Step 5: Load Skills

If you're running an agent platform (OpenClaw, Hermes, or any repo with a workspace),
scaffold the bundled skills into it:

```bash
cd /path/to/agent/workspace
gbrain skillpack scaffold --all       # copy the 50+ bundled skills + RESOLVER.md
```

Scaffolded skills are first-class files in your repo. Edit freely; re-running scaffold
refuses to overwrite anything that exists. Use `gbrain skillpack reference <name>` to
diff against gbrain's bundle when you want upstream improvements. (The legacy
`gbrain skillpack install` managed-block model was removed in v0.33 — run
`gbrain skillpack migrate-fence` once if upgrading from an older release.)

> **PGLite brains are single-process (applies to every MCP registration
> below).** PGLite is a single-writer embedded Postgres: the first running
> `gbrain serve` owns the brain's data directory via the data-dir lock. A
> second `serve` (gbrain registered in two harnesses on the same machine) —
> or any CLI command that opens the DB — fails on the lock while that serve
> is live (`gbrain sync` is the one exception: it delegates to the live
> serve). If multiple processes need the brain at once, run ONE shared
> `gbrain serve --http` and point every client at it, or migrate to the
> Postgres/Supabase engine, which tolerates concurrent connections. Details:
> [docs/architecture/serve-sync-concurrency.md](docs/architecture/serve-sync-concurrency.md).

**If you are Hermes:** register gbrain as your MCP server:

```bash
printf 'Y\n' | hermes mcp add gbrain --env GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME --connect-timeout 60 --command $(which gbrain) --args serve
```

Keep `--args` last (everything after it becomes server argv) and verify with
`hermes mcp test gbrain` — the add exits 0 even on failure. Full reference:
[docs/mcp/HERMES.md](docs/mcp/HERMES.md).

**If you are Grok Build** (xAI's `grok` CLI): register gbrain as your MCP server:

```bash
grok mcp add gbrain -e "GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME" -- gbrain serve --surface verbs
```

The add is lazy (exit 0 without connecting) — verify with
`grok mcp doctor gbrain`, which spawns the server and must report
`7 tools discovered`. This is the brain-only install; the `gbrain bootstrap`
personal-agent path does not support Grok yet (Claude Code, Codex, and opencode only).
Verified against Grok Build v1.0.4. Full reference:
[docs/mcp/GROK.md](docs/mcp/GROK.md).

**If you are opencode** (the SST terminal agent, opencode.ai — not OpenClaw):
you are a bootstrap-supported harness — for the full persistent-personal-agent
install, follow `BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md` instead of this page. For the
brain-only MCP registration:

```bash
opencode mcp add gbrain --env GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME -- gbrain serve --surface verbs
```

The add is lazy (exit 0 without connecting) — verify with `opencode mcp list`,
which spawns the server and must show `✓ gbrain connected` (the exit code is 0
even on failure; read the output). Restart opencode afterwards — it reads
config at session start. Verified against opencode v1.18.18. Full reference:
[docs/mcp/OPENCODE.md](docs/mcp/OPENCODE.md).

Whether you scaffolded or not, read `skills/RESOLVER.md` (in your workspace, or the
bundled copy at `~/gbrain/skills/RESOLVER.md` when running from the cloned repo). It's
the skill dispatcher — tells you which skill to read for any task. Save this to your
memory permanently.

The three most important skills to adopt immediately:

1. **Signal detector** (`skills/signal-detector/SKILL.md`) — fire this on EVERY
   inbound message. It captures ideas and entities in parallel. The brain compounds.

2. **Brain-ops** (`skills/brain-ops/SKILL.md`) — brain-first lookup on every response.
   Check the brain before any external API call.

3. **Conventions** (`skills/conventions/quality.md`) — citation format, back-linking
   iron law, source attribution. These are non-negotiable quality rules.

## Step 6: Identity (optional)

Run the soul-audit skill to customize the agent's identity:

```
Read skills/soul-audit/SKILL.md and follow it.
```

This generates SOUL.md (agent identity), USER.md (user profile), ACCESS_POLICY.md
(who sees what), and HEARTBEAT.md (operational cadence) from the user's answers.

If skipped, minimal defaults are installed automatically.

## Step 7: Recurring Jobs

Set up using your platform's scheduler (OpenClaw cron, Railway cron, crontab), or skip the
platform glue entirely with `gbrain autopilot --install` (built-in self-maintaining daemon):

- **Live sync** (every 15 min): `gbrain sync --repo ~/brain && gbrain embed --stale`
  — or `gbrain sync --watch` for a continuous loop. Safe on keyless brains:
  a bare `gbrain embed --stale` exits 0 with a stderr note when embeddings
  are disabled, so the chain doesn't break.
- **Health gate** (daily): `gbrain autopilot --status` — exit 0 fresh (or
  nothing installed), 1 needs attention (stale heartbeat, never ran, or
  paused), 2 the daemon took itself out of rotation. Filesystem-only, so it
  works during DB outages.
- **Auto-update** (daily): `gbrain check-update --json` (tell user, never auto-install).
- **Dream cycle** (nightly): `gbrain dream` runs the 8-phase overnight maintenance cycle.
  Entity sweep, citation fixes, memory consolidation, plus (v0.23+) overnight conversation
  synthesis and cross-session pattern detection. One cron-friendly command. This is what
  makes the brain compound. Do not skip it. See `docs/guides/cron-schedule.md` for the
  full protocol.
- **Weekly**: `gbrain doctor --json && gbrain embed --stale`

## Step 8: Integrations

Run `gbrain integrations list`. Each recipe in `~/gbrain/recipes/` is a self-contained
installer. It tells you what credentials to ask for, how to validate, and what cron
to register. Ask the user which integrations they want (email, calendar, voice, Twitter).

Verify: `gbrain integrations doctor` (after at least one is configured)

## Step 9: Verify

Read `docs/GBRAIN_VERIFY.md` and run every verification check in it. Check #4
(live sync actually works) is the most important.

Once verification passes and the brain has content, run the activation probe:

```bash
gbrain onboard --check --json
```

See "The onboard surface" below for what the recommendations mean and the
consent gates around unattended remediation.

## Upgrade

If you installed via `bun install -g`:

```bash
gbrain upgrade                        # self-updates the binary, runs schema migrations,
                                      # and prints post-upgrade notes for the version range
```

If you installed via `git clone + bun link`:

```bash
cd ~/gbrain && git pull origin master && bun install
gbrain apply-migrations --yes         # apply schema migrations (idempotent)
gbrain post-upgrade                   # show migration notes for the version range
```

Then read `~/gbrain/skills/migrations/v<NEW_VERSION>.md` (and any intermediate
versions you skipped) and run any backfill or verification steps it lists. Skipping
this is how features ship in the binary but stay dormant in the user's brain.

**v0.32.3 search modes (one-time upgrade prompt):** if the user's brain was
created before v0.32.3, `gbrain post-upgrade` prints a banner including the
9-cell cost matrix (mode × downstream model) preceded by `[AGENT]` markers.
**Do NOT silently move past the banner.** Present the matrix to the operator
verbatim, ask which mode they want (recommended default: `tokenmax` to preserve
v0.31.x retrieval shape), then run `gbrain config set search.mode <mode>`. See
Step 3.5 above for the full ask-the-user protocol — the upgrade path uses the
same matrix and same default.

For v0.12.0+ specifically: if your brain was created before v0.12.0, run
`gbrain extract links --source db && gbrain extract timeline --source db` to
backfill the new graph layer (see Step 4.5 above).

For v0.12.2+ specifically: if your brain is Postgres- or Supabase-backed and
predates v0.12.2, the `v0_12_2` migration runs `gbrain repair-jsonb`
automatically during `gbrain post-upgrade` to fix the double-encoded JSONB
columns. PGLite brains no-op. If wiki-style imports were truncated by the old
`splitBody` bug, run `gbrain sync --full` after upgrading to rebuild
`compiled_truth` from source markdown.

## The onboard surface

`gbrain onboard` is the activation surface gbrain did not have before.
Once your brain has any content, run `gbrain onboard --check --json` to
see structured recommendations across 5 brain-health axes (orphans,
stale embeddings, entity link coverage, timeline coverage, takes count).

**On first connect (after `gbrain init`):**
```bash
gbrain onboard --check --json
```
The JSON envelope (`schema_version: 1`) carries `recommendations[]` with
`apply_policy` per item: `auto_apply` (safe to run unattended),
`prompt_required` (needs explicit user consent), or `manual_only`
(LLM-bearing, user must run themselves).

**After every `gbrain upgrade`:**
```bash
gbrain onboard --check --json
```
New versions may surface new opportunities. The post-upgrade banner
nudges the user when it runs, but agents should re-probe as a hygiene
step regardless.

**Unattended remediation (cron / autopilot):**
```bash
gbrain onboard --auto --max-usd 5
```
Refuses without `--max-usd N`. Runs auto-eligible items only. The
autopilot daemon also consults onboard recommendations on its tick — no
explicit agent action needed for the autonomous path.

**Remote / federated brain installs (MCP):**
The `run_onboard` MCP op (admin scope) lets thin-client agents probe
brain health + drive remediation over OAuth-authenticated MCP. Protected
LLM-bearing handlers (synthesize, patterns, consolidate, takes-bootstrap,
contextual_reindex_per_chunk) require the additional `run_protected_onboard`
scope — admin alone is insufficient. The MCP op returns
`skipped_missing_scope[]` listing what would have run with the right
grants.

**Privacy + consent gates:**
- `gbrain takes extract --from-pages` sends concept/atom/lore/briefing/
  writing/originals page content to your configured chat model (default
  Anthropic Haiku). Refuses to run unless `takes.bootstrap_enabled=true`
  is set in config AND `--yes` is passed. Two-gate opt-in by design.
- Autopilot's auto-apply tier for takes-bootstrap stays `manual_only`
  until v0.42.1's eval gate (do not bypass).

**Suppress nudges in CI / scripted environments:**
```bash
export GBRAIN_NO_ONBOARD_NUDGE=1
```
Init + upgrade banners auto-skip in non-TTY too.
