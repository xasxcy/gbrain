/**
 * Query expansion over the `claude-cli` recipe.
 *
 * Two independent defects made expansion a silent no-op for any brain whose
 * expansion model resolves to a `claude-cli:` string (the default when
 * `models.tier.utility` points there). Both are pinned here, because either
 * one alone reproduces the same user-visible symptom — `query` degrading to a
 * single-embedding `search` with no error, no log line, and no `degraded`
 * stamp:
 *
 *   1. The recipe declared no `expansion` touchpoint, so
 *      `isAvailable('expansion')` was false for EVERY claude-cli model and
 *      `expand()` returned `[query]` before any model call.
 *   2. With the touchpoint declared but the transport unchanged, expand()
 *      took the native generateObject path. ClaudeCliLanguageModel.doGenerate
 *      ignores `options.responseFormat`, so the CLI answers with
 *      markdown-fenced JSON as ordinary text, generateObject (ai@6) throws
 *      NoObjectGeneratedError (swallowed by expand()'s outer catch), and the
 *      native branch has no viaText fallback — expansion paid for a
 *      subprocess round trip on every query and discarded the answer.
 *
 * Hermetic: routes through __setGenerateTextTransportForTests /
 * __setGenerateObjectTransportForTests, so no subprocess, network, or env
 * variable is touched.
