/**
 * #2540 — doctor's `cycle_freshness` must define "full cycle" against the
 * ENABLED phase set (pack-declared ∩ config-enabled), not the universe of
 * every phase `ALL_PHASES` could ever run.
 *
 * Investigation finding (documented here so a future reader doesn't
 * re-litigate it): on this codebase, that half of the issue was already
 * correctly handled BEFORE this fix —
 *
 *   - A phase the active pack doesn't declare (`extract_atoms`,
 *     `synthesize_concepts`) reports `status: 'skipped'` with
 *     `reason: 'not_in_active_pack'` (src/core/cycle.ts, the
 *     `packDeclaresPhase` gate). A config-disabled phase (`drift`,
 *     `enrich_thin`, `skillopt`, `conversation_facts_backfill`,
 *     `synthesize` with no corpus dir configured) is also `'skipped'`.
 *   - `deriveStatus` only downgrades the report on `'warn'`/`'fail'`
 *     phases; `'skipped'` phases are excluded from both `anyWarn` and
 *     `anyFailed`/`allFailed`.
 *   - The `last_full_cycle_at` stamp gate (runCycle's exit hook) already
 *     writes on `status === 'ok' | 'clean' | 'partial'` — only a fully
 *     'failed' cycle (every attempted phase failed) skips the write.
 *
 * So a pack that omits optional phases, with every phase it DOES enable
 * completing, was already stamped — test 1 below pins that (it passes
 * on both sides of this PR's actual fix, which lives in
 * `resolveSourceForDir`'s symlink handling; see
 * test/dream-dir-source-stamp.test.ts for the part that regresses
 * without the fix).
 *
 * Test 2 pins the other side the issue explicitly calls out: the fix
 * must not "weaken the check into uselessness" — when every attempted
 * phase genuinely fails, the cycle must still report 'failed' and must
 * NOT stamp `last_full_cycle_at`, so doctor's cycle_freshness can still
 * catch a real problem.
