/**
 * #4359 — hybridSearchCached() and the bare hybridSearch() it calls on a
 * miss/disabled outcome each independently call `loadSearchModeConfig(engine)`
 * (mode.ts). That's a second DB-plane config round trip on every
 * `hybridSearchCached` call, AND — if `search.mode` / `search.searchLimit` /
 * another per-key override changes between the two reads — a desync: the
 * cache row gets keyed (`knobsHash`) from the outer (stale) config read while
 * its actual size/contents come from the inner (newer) read.
 *
 * Context (checked before writing these tests, per the coordinator's note):
 * `semanticResultCacheAvailable()` (query-cache.ts) is hardcoded `false` right
 * now, so `hybridSearchCached` never actually reads a HIT or writes a cache
 * row in this repo's current state — every call takes the miss/disabled
 * branch. That does NOT make the double config read moot: both reads happen
 * unconditionally, at the top of each function, regardless of whether the
 * semantic result cache itself is live. These tests exercise ONLY the
 * miss/disabled path (no cache HIT, no cache row write) and pin the read
 * count directly — they do not depend on the cache being enabled, and they
 * stay meaningful once it's turned back on (that's exactly when the desync
 * this fix closes becomes observable again).
 *
 * Seam: `loadSearchModeConfig` itself, module-mocked so the count and the
 * returned snapshot are fully decoupled from the OTHER config reads
 * `hybridSearch`/`hybridSearchCached` also perform (loadConfigWithEngine for
 * the embedding column, loadEngineIntentPatterns, loadCacheConfig, ...) —
 * none of those are part of this bug or this fix.
