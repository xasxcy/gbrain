# GBrain

**Search gives you raw pages. GBrain gives you the answer.** It's the brain layer your AI agent has been missing — the only one that does synthesis, graph traversal, and gap analysis in one box. Run a full autonomous agent on top of it, or just wire it into Claude Code or Codex as a supercharged retrieval layer in one command; either way your coding agent stops being amnesiac about everything that isn't code.

I'm Garry Tan, President and CEO of Y Combinator. I built GBrain to run my own AI agents. It's the production brain behind my OpenClaw and Hermes deployments: **155,795 pages, 24,589 people, 5,340 companies**, 66 cron jobs running autonomously. My agent ingests meetings, emails, tweets, voice calls, and original ideas while I sleep. It enriches every person and company it encounters. It fixes its own citations and consolidates memory overnight. I wake up smarter than when I went to bed — and so will you.

**And now it works as a company brain too.** Each person on the team gets their own slice of the brain, scoped by login. When you query, you only see what you're allowed to see — never another person's notes, never another team's data. We fuzz-tested this across every way you can read the brain (search, list, lookup, multi-source reads) and got zero leaks. Drop GBrain in as your team's shared institutional memory — the [company-brain](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs#company-brain) shape YC just put on its Request for Startups. If you're building in that space, you might as well build on this. **[Tutorial: set up GBrain as your company brain →](docs/tutorials/company-brain.md)**

Lots of personal-knowledge systems give you keyword matching and grep in a box. GBrain does that, and adds two things nobody else ships together:

- **A synthesis layer that gives you the actual answer.** Synthesized, well-cited prose across people, companies, deals, and ideas. Not "here are 10 chunks that mention your query"; an actual answer with citations and an explicit note on what the brain doesn't know yet. The gap analysis is the part that changes how you use the brain.
- **A self-wiring knowledge graph.** Every page write extracts entity refs and creates typed edges (`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`) with zero LLM calls. Ask "who works at Acme AI?" or "what did Bob invest in this quarter?" and get answers vector search alone can't reach. Benchmarked: **P@5 49.1%, R@5 97.9%** on a 240-page Opus-generated rich-prose corpus, **+31.4 points P@5** over its graph-disabled variant and over ripgrep-BM25 + vector-only RAG by a similar margin. Full BrainBench scorecards live in the sibling [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) repo.

The point of building a 150K-page brain is to use it as a strategic moat. To never lose context. To query what's in your own head without re-reading it. The brain layer is what makes the moat usable. The 24/7 dream cycle is what keeps it sharp. Both run on your hardware, your DB, your keys.

It's easier to ship a daemon that runs 24/7 to ingest, enrich, and consolidate than it is to keep an agent in chat working hard. GBrain is that daemon, generalized. Install in 30 minutes. Your agent does the work. As my personal agent gets smarter, so does yours.

> **~15 minutes to a working personal agent** on the recommended Codex / Claude Code path (mostly a short interview); ~30 minutes for the always-on OpenClaw / Hermes setup. Database ready in 2 seconds either way (PGLite, no server).

> **LLMs:** fetch [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) for the documentation map, or [`llms-full.txt`](llms-full.txt) for the same map with core docs inlined in one fetch. **Agents:** start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (or [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) if you're Claude Code).

## What this looks like

Say you have a meeting with Alice tomorrow. You want to walk in remembering what she works on, when you last talked, and what's still open between you. Here's what you'd type, and what you'd get back.

**You ask:**

> "What do I need to know before my meeting with Alice tomorrow?"

**Most personal-knowledge tools give you back a list of pages.** Something like:

```
1. people/alice — Alice runs engineering at Acme...
2. meetings/2026-03-15-alice-q1 — Q1 product review with Alice...
3. meetings/2026-01-08-acme-kickoff — Kickoff meeting with Acme team...
4. customers/acme — Acme is a series-B fintech we work with...
5. notes/2026-04-22 — Quick chat with Alice about pricing...
```

Five pages you now have to open and read yourself to actually prepare. The tool found the right material, but it didn't do the work.

**GBrain gives you back the answer, with sources:**

```
Alice runs engineering at Acme (a series-B fintech). You last spoke
on April 22 in a quick pricing chat. Three things are still open
from that conversation:

1. She owes you the security review for the new tier
   (deadline was May 1; no update since).
2. You committed to pricing for a 500-seat tier
   (you sent it April 25; no response yet).
3. She mentioned they're hiring a CISO; you said you'd intro
   someone from your network.

Heads up: nothing's been added to the brain about Alice or Acme
since April 22, six weeks ago. She may have replied through email
or Slack DM, channels the brain doesn't see. Worth asking her to
catch up before assuming any of this is still current.
```

Every claim has a source page behind it. The "heads up" at the end tells you what the brain doesn't know yet, so you can ask Alice about it directly instead of being surprised. The brain just did your meeting prep.

This is the difference between a search engine and a brain. Search finds the pages. The brain reads them for you and writes the answer.

## Install

> [!WARNING]
> **GBrain is NOT distributed on npm.** The npm package named `gbrain` is an unrelated
> package with no connection to this project. Do not run `npm install -g gbrain` or
> `bun add -g gbrain` — you'll get something else, and it can shadow the real binary on
> your PATH. Install and upgrade ONLY via the documented paths below
> (`bun install -g github:garrytan/gbrain`, or `git clone` + `bun install && bun link`).
> If you already ran the npm install by mistake: `npm uninstall -g gbrain` /
> `bun remove -g gbrain`, then reinstall from GitHub. `gbrain doctor` detects a
> shadowing npm install and prints the fix.

GBrain is designed to be installed and operated by an AI agent. **New to GBrain? Start with Codex** — it runs on the ChatGPT subscription you already have, takes ~15 minutes, and deploys nothing. Already living in Claude Code? Its path is identical. Want GBrain running the way it was designed to run — always on, enriching your brain around the clock? That's OpenClaw or Hermes, at real server + API cost. Each path below is complete on its own. (Wiring it up by hand instead? Jump to [CLI standalone](#cli-standalone-no-agent) or the [MCP table](#connect-gbrain-to-your-ai-client-mcp).)

### For Codex — the recommended first step

Turn Codex into your persistent personal agent. (Just want the brain + skills without the full agent? `codex plugin marketplace add garrytan/gbrain@codex-plugin` then `codex plugin add gbrain@gbrain` — see [docs/mcp/CODEX.md](docs/mcp/CODEX.md). The paste block below builds the whole agent.) Works in the **ChatGPT desktop app** (open Codex on a folder) and in the **Codex CLI** (`codex` in a terminal) — same install, same result. Open Codex in a **new, empty folder** (not an existing code project) — that folder becomes your agent's own **private GitHub repo**, which bootstrap creates and privacy-verifies for you. Then paste:

```
Read and follow every step of:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/latest-stable/BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md
Goal: set yourself up as my persistent personal agent in this folder, with gbrain
as your memory. Interview me before writing any identity file — never invent
answers. Ask before anything destructive. You are not done until
`gbrain bootstrap verify` exits 0.
```

Codex will ask for command approvals during the install — approving them is the sandbox working as intended. What you get, in about 15 minutes: a short interview (6 required questions) → your agent's identity (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md) rendered from your own answers, never invented → a local PGLite brain (2 seconds, no server, no Docker) → MCP wired so every session can search and write memory → a **private** GitHub repo, created and privacy-verified, as your agent's durable body. Works with **zero API keys** — keyword search plus memory your agent writes itself; one optional key upgrades capabilities (OpenAI: semantic search + automatic fact extraction; Voyage: semantic search; Anthropic: fact extraction). Codex reads brain context through its tools each turn (pull-based). The click moment: tell it one small thing to remember, restart Codex, then ask for it back — the answer comes from the brain, not from this chat's context (which the restart cleared). That cross-session round-trip is the whole product; "what's my name / my top jobs?" is answered from your identity files, which is nice but not the same trick.

Two things worth understanding once it's running: **you own the brain** — every memory is a markdown file in that private repo (read it, clone it to a second machine, delete it and the brain is gone) — and **the first skill to run is `cold-start`**: say "fill my brain" and your agent imports your Gmail, calendar, and contacts (via [ClawVisor](https://clawvisor.com), an OAuth vault so the agent never holds raw tokens) or offline archives like Google Takeout, one consented step at a time. An empty brain is a database; a filled one is a memory.

> **Prefer to make the repo yourself?** Create a new **empty** private repo **under your own GitHub account** (no README/.gitignore/license), clone it, open the clone in Codex, and paste the same block — bootstrap detects your empty repo and adopts it instead of creating one. The repo must be empty and personal-account-owned; org-owned repos are refused (create one under your account, or let bootstrap make it).

### For Claude Code — turn it into your persistent personal agent

Works in the **desktop app** and in the **CLI** (`claude` in a terminal) — identical harness, identical result. Open Claude Code in a **new, empty folder** (not an existing code project) — that folder becomes your agent's own **private GitHub repo**, created and privacy-verified for you. Then paste the same block:

```
Read and follow every step of:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/latest-stable/BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md
Goal: set yourself up as my persistent personal agent in this folder, with gbrain
as your memory. Interview me before writing any identity file — never invent
answers. Ask before anything destructive. You are not done until
`gbrain bootstrap verify` exits 0.
```

Everything from the Codex path applies — interview, identity from your own answers, local brain, private repo, keyless mode — plus Claude Code gets **per-turn context hooks** (on by default, with an opt-out): your brain loads automatically into every prompt, and your work persists to your private repo on a per-turn cadence (debounced ~5 min locally, every turn in a cloud sandbox — this covers the `/exit` case the harness never fires a session-end hook on), with a notice on your next turn if a push ever fails. This works in a **Claude Code cloud session** too, not just on your laptop: verification falls back to pure git protocol when the sandbox blocks the GitHub API, and `gbrain bootstrap cloud-setup-script` prints the environment setup recipe. The click moment: tell it one small thing to remember, restart the session, then ask for it back — a fresh session has no chat context, so the answer can only come from the brain. That cross-session round-trip is the whole product ("what's my name?" is answered from your identity files — nice, but not the same trick). Same two follow-ups as the Codex path: you own the brain (markdown in your private repo), and `cold-start` is the first skill to run — "fill my brain" imports your email, calendar, and contacts (ClawVisor) or offline archives, one consented step at a time. Full contract, security posture, cloud sandboxes, and uninstall: [docs/guides/bootstrap.md](docs/guides/bootstrap.md).

> **Prefer to make the repo yourself?** Create a new **empty** private repo **under your own GitHub account** (no README/.gitignore/license), clone it, open the clone in Claude Code (CLI or the desktop app's open-a-repo flow), and paste the same block — bootstrap adopts your empty repo instead of creating one. The repo must be empty and personal-account-owned; org-owned repos are refused.

### For OpenClaw or Hermes — GBrain as intended, always on

This is GBrain used the way it was designed to be used: a server-hosted agent with 24/7 crons, continuous ingestion, and the overnight dream cycle that enriches your brain while you sleep — your agent works whether your laptop is open or not. It's also the highest-cost path: a deployed server (8GB+ RAM) plus raw API token usage that scales with how hard your agent runs, well beyond a chat subscription. Start here if you want the full experience from day one; start with Codex above if you want to feel it first. If you don't have a platform running yet, both deploy in one click:

- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** — deploy [AlphaClaw on Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/alphaclaw) (one click, 8GB+ RAM)
- **[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** — deploy on [Railway](https://github.com/praveen-ks-2001/hermes-agent-template) (one click)

Then paste this into your agent:

```
Retrieve and follow the instructions at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md
```

The agent installs GBrain, creates the brain, asks for your API keys, loads the 50+ bundled skills, configures the dream cycle, and verifies the install end-to-end. ~30 minutes. You answer questions, it does the work.

> **Never set up an AI agent platform before?** The [personal-brain tutorial](docs/tutorials/personal-brain.md) walks the whole path end-to-end — picking OpenClaw vs Hermes, deploying it, pointing it at INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md, getting the API keys, and verifying the first query. Start there if any of the above is new.

### Lighter ways in

**Just want a memory for your coding agent — no identity, no repo.** Spin up a local brain and connect it in two commands — zero server, zero token, zero tunnel. `--surface verbs` gives your agent the seven-verb memory protocol (`recall`, `remember`, `entity`, `synthesize`, `forget`, plus `context_pack` + `delta` since v0.45.7 — [MEMORY_VERBS v1](docs/protocol/MEMORY_VERBS_v1.md), frozen + additive-forever) instead of the full tool wall; drop the flag for every operation:

```bash
gbrain init --pglite                                    # 2-second local brain (no Docker)
claude mcp add gbrain -- gbrain serve --surface verbs   # or: codex mcp add gbrain -- gbrain serve --surface verbs
```

If `claude` is not found, install Claude Code first — or use the per-harness blocks in the [protocol doc](docs/protocol/MEMORY_VERBS_v1.md). Heads-up: memories agents save default to brain-wide visibility (every connected agent can recall them); pass `visibility: "private"` for local-only facts.

**Already have a brain on a remote host** (OpenClaw, Hermes, or any `gbrain serve --http`)? Point your laptop agents at it with one command each — `--install` wires it up and smoke-tests the token before handoff:

```bash
gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --token gbrain_xxx --install               # Claude Code
gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --token gbrain_xxx --agent codex --install # Codex
```

Onboarding a whole agent harness onto a shared brain? On the brain host, `gbrain agent register <name> --harness claude-code` mints a scoped OAuth client plus a 30-day token and prints the paste-ready wiring block — presets for daily-driver and write-isolated coding agents. The [onboarding decision table](docs/guides/agent-to-gbrain.md#onboarding-paths--the-decision-table) says which path fits.

**Brain-only install into another coding agent** (Cursor, Claude Cowork, or anything that can fetch a URL and run shell commands) — paste the OpenClaw/Hermes block above (`INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`); it installs the brain, skills, and dream cycle without the personal-agent identity layer. Tested with Codex, Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, and AlphaClaw.

**[→ Full walkthrough: give your coding agent a memory](docs/tutorials/connect-coding-agent.md)** — the memory-only paths end to end, plus the brain-first protocol you paste into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` and the four habits that make it actually change how you work.

### CLI standalone (no agent)

```bash
bun install -g github:garrytan/gbrain
gbrain init --pglite     # 2 seconds; no server, no Docker
gbrain doctor            # verify health
gbrain import ~/notes/   # index your markdown
gbrain query "what themes show up across my notes?"
```

Postgres-at-scale, Supabase, and thin-client setup paths live in [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).

### Connect GBrain to your AI client (MCP)

GBrain exposes nearly all of its 100+ operations as MCP tools (stdio and HTTP; a handful of local-only ops stay CLI-side) — or exactly the seven memory verbs with `--surface verbs`. The specific snippet depends on which client you use:

- **[Claude Code](docs/mcp/CLAUDE_CODE.md)** — plugin: `/plugin marketplace add garrytan/gbrain` + `/plugin install gbrain@gbrain` (MCP + skills; persona variants `gbrain-coding` / `gbrain-daily` install curated subsets — pick exactly one gbrain plugin). Marketplace-free skills: `gbrain skillpack scaffold --harness claude-code` copies a persona-curated skill set into your user-scope skills dir with a local-edit-respecting update lens. Or local one-liner: `claude mcp add gbrain -- gbrain serve` (zero server, zero tunnel). Remote with just a bearer token: `gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --token gbrain_xxx` prints a paste-ready block (or `--install` wires it up and smoke-tests the token).
- **[Codex](docs/mcp/CODEX.md)** — plugin (recommended): `codex plugin marketplace add garrytan/gbrain@codex-plugin` + `codex plugin add gbrain@gbrain` installs the MCP server AND the curated skill set. Or connect-only: `gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --token gbrain_xxx --agent codex` (or `--install`); Codex reads the bearer from `$GBRAIN_REMOTE_TOKEN` at runtime, so the token never lands in Codex config.
- **[Cursor / Windsurf / any stdio MCP client](docs/mcp/CLAUDE_CODE.md)** — same shape, add `{"command": "gbrain", "args": ["serve"]}` to your MCP config.
- **[Hermes](docs/mcp/HERMES.md)** — `printf 'Y\n' | hermes mcp add gbrain --env GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME --connect-timeout 60 --command $(which gbrain) --args serve`. Keep `--args` last, and verify with `hermes mcp test gbrain` (the add exits 0 even on failure).
- **[Grok Build](docs/mcp/GROK.md)** — `grok mcp add gbrain -e "GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME" -- gbrain serve --surface verbs`. The add is lazy (exit 0 without connecting) — verify with `grok mcp doctor gbrain`, which spawns the server and reports `7 tools discovered`. Verified against Grok Build v1.0.4.
- **[opencode](docs/mcp/OPENCODE.md)** (opencode.ai / SST — not OpenClaw) — `opencode mcp add gbrain --env GBRAIN_HOME=$HOME -- gbrain serve --surface verbs`, or let `gbrain bootstrap hooks --harness opencode` write the config for you (opencode is a bootstrap-supported harness — it reads AGENTS.md natively). The add is lazy — verify with `opencode mcp list`, which spawns the server (`✓ gbrain connected`). Remote: `gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --token gbrain_xxx --agent opencode [--install]` — the config stores only the `{env:GBRAIN_REMOTE_TOKEN}` interpolation. Verified against opencode v1.18.18.
- **[OpenClaw](docs/mcp/OPENCLAW.md)** — the ClawHub bundle plugin registers gbrain automatically (`openclaw.plugin.json` ships in this repo), or add `{"command": "gbrain", "args": ["serve"]}` to `~/.openclaw/config.json`'s `mcpServers`.
- **[Claude Desktop (Cowork)](docs/mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md)** — Settings → Integrations → add the URL of your HTTP server. Remote only; the local `claude_desktop_config.json` does not work for remote servers.
- **[Claude Cowork (team plan)](docs/mcp/CLAUDE_COWORK.md)** — org Owner adds the connector under Organization Settings → Connectors.
- **[Perplexity Computer](docs/mcp/PERPLEXITY.md)** — `gbrain connect https://your-host/mcp --agent perplexity --oauth --register` mints a least-privilege OAuth client and prints the Issuer/Client ID/Secret to paste into Settings → Connectors (OAuth is the right path for a cloud connector; a bearer token also works for local use). Pro subscription required.
- **[ChatGPT](docs/mcp/CHATGPT.md)** — uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (the hard requirement). Register a `chatgpt` client from the admin dashboard with grant type `authorization_code`.

For the HTTP server itself:

```bash
gbrain serve              # stdio MCP (local subprocess; for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
gbrain serve --http       # HTTP MCP with OAuth 2.1 + admin dashboard at /admin
                          # (required for Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity, ChatGPT)
```

The HTTP server includes DCR-style client registration, scope-gated access (`read` / `write` / `admin`), and rate limiting. Deployment guides (ngrok, Railway, Fly.io) live under [`docs/mcp/`](docs/mcp/).

## Two ways to query your brain

Raw retrieval (what most personal-knowledge tools ship) and a synthesis layer that gives you an actual answer. They serve different jobs.

```bash
# raw retrieval: top pages by hybrid score, fast, no LLM cost
gbrain search "who's working on AI agents at portfolio companies?"

# brain layer: synthesized answer with citations and gap analysis
gbrain think "who's working on AI agents at portfolio companies?"
```

**`gbrain search`** returns the top retrieved pages, ranked by hybrid scoring (vector + keyword + RRF + source-tier boost + reranker). Use it when you want raw material to skim: agent context windows, citation lookups, finding a specific quote.

**`gbrain think`** runs the same retrieval, then composes a synthesized answer across the results with explicit citations to the source pages AND an honest note on what the brain doesn't know yet. The gap analysis is the differentiator: the answer tells you when a page is stale, when a claim is uncited, when two pages contradict each other, when there's a hole you should fill.

**Why it compounds.** Pair the brain layer with `find_trajectory` and you get answers like *"how have the company's metrics changed AND what does the team look like right now AND what did they promise / share AND when did we last meet AND what's the value-add I can offer here"*: well-scored, well-cited, in one shot. That's the strategic moat. That's why building a 150K-page brain is worth the effort.

`gbrain agent run "..."` exposes the same surface to a sub-agent through the Minions queue, with crash-safe two-phase persistence. Same answers, durable.

## How to get data in

One command, local or hosted, synchronous receipt:

```bash
gbrain capture "the thought I want to remember"
gbrain capture --file ./notes/today.md
echo "from a pipe" | gbrain capture --stdin
SLUG=$(gbrain capture "..." --quiet)
```

The page lands in the database and on disk in one move. Default slug `inbox/YYYY-MM-DD-<hash8>` so captures cluster in a predictable triage location. On thin-client installs the verb routes through MCP to the server: same command, same UX.

For webhook ingestion (Zapier / IFTTT / Apple Shortcuts):

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-brain/ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" \
  -d "# a thought from a Shortcut"
```

For mobile capture, the inbox folder source picks up anything dropped into
`~/.gbrain/inbox/` from iOS Shortcuts / AirDrop / Drafts / Finder.

Your other agents' histories import in one command. `gbrain transcripts ingest`
parses agent session logs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes) and extracted
consumer chat exports (ChatGPT / Claude.ai `conversations.json`) into readable
conversation pages with provenance back to the exact session file. Secrets are
scrubbed from message bodies, titles, speakers, and session metadata before
anything is written, embedding is off by default for bulk backfills, and
re-runs are free — unchanged sessions skip on content hash:

```bash
gbrain transcripts ingest                    # discover importable session logs
gbrain transcripts ingest --all              # import everything discovered
gbrain transcripts ingest ~/Downloads/conversations.json  # consumer export (unzip first)
gbrain transcripts ingest --max-bytes 4gb <store>          # oversized store; omit to keep per-format caps
gbrain transcripts status                    # found vs imported, per harness
```

Third-party skillpacks can ship custom ingestion sources (Granola, Linear,
voice, OCR) against the versioned `IngestionSource` contract at
`gbrain/ingestion`. See [`docs/skillpack-anatomy.md`](docs/skillpack-anatomy.md).

## Your brain's shape (schema packs)

Most personal-knowledge tools force one fixed layout: their idea of "notes" + "people" + "tags." Drop a Notion export or your own years-old Obsidian vault on top, and the agent doesn't know what a `Projects/` folder means or whether `Reading/` is people or sources.

**gbrain doesn't have a fixed layout.** It ships with bundled schema packs and lets you author your own when none fit:

- **`gbrain-base-v2`** (default as of v0.41.22) — 15-type DRY/MECE canonical taxonomy (14 canonical + `note` catch-all): `person`, `company`, `media`, `tweet`, `social-digest`, `analysis`, `atom`, `concept`, `source`, `deal`, `email`, `slack`, `writing`, `project`, `note`. Subtypes/format/origin pushed to frontmatter. The taxonomy that responds to issue #1479.
- **`gbrain-base`** (legacy, v0.41 and earlier brains) — the original 24-type layout. Stays bundled for back-compat; brains on it can upgrade via `gbrain onboard --check --explain` → `gbrain jobs submit unify-types --allow-protected --params '{"target_pack":"gbrain-base-v2","apply":true}'` (omit `"apply":true` for a dry-run preview — that is the default).
- **`gbrain-recommended`** — extends `gbrain-base` with the 13 additional directories from `docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md` (source, place, trip, conversation, personal, civic, project, etc.). Activate with `gbrain schema use gbrain-recommended`.
- **Your own pack** — `gbrain schema detect` clusters your actual filesystem into proposed types, `gbrain schema suggest` runs an LLM pass over them, and `gbrain schema review-candidates --apply` promotes the ones you like. Three commands and the brain knows your shape. Authoring a successor pack (declares `migration_from:` so existing brains can opt in): see [`docs/architecture/pack-upgrade-mechanism.md`](docs/architecture/pack-upgrade-mechanism.md).

```bash
gbrain schema active                # which pack is running, which tier set it
gbrain schema list                  # bundled + installed packs
gbrain schema detect                # propose types matching your filesystem
gbrain schema suggest               # LLM-refined proposals on top of detect
gbrain schema review-candidates     # human gate: promote / rename / ignore
gbrain schema use my-pack           # activate
```

The active pack threads through every read + write path: `parseMarkdown` infers page type from the pack's path prefixes; `whoknows` scopes expert routing to types declared `expert_routing: true`; `extract_facts` runs only on `extractable: true` types; the search cache folds the pack name + version into its key so cross-pack contamination is structurally impossible. Switch packs and the brain re-interprets itself; switch back and nothing's lost.

Seven-tier resolution chain (per-call flag → env var → per-source DB key → brain-wide DB key → `gbrain.yml` → `~/.gbrain/config.json` → `gbrain-base` default). Full reference + authoring guide: [`docs/architecture/schema-packs.md`](docs/architecture/schema-packs.md).

## Tutorials

Step-by-step walkthroughs for getting the most out of GBrain. Each one takes you from zero to a working outcome, with concrete commands and real numbers.

- [**Set up your personal AI agent + brain from zero**](docs/tutorials/personal-brain.md) — the canonical full-stack install. Two GitHub repos, a Telegram bot, AlphaClaw on Render, OpenClaw + GBrain + Supabase. End-to-end in about 2 hours.
- [**Set up GBrain as your company brain**](docs/tutorials/company-brain.md) — federated, multi-user, OAuth-scoped institutional memory for a 10-50 person team. About 90 minutes end-to-end.
- [**Auto-improve a skill with `gbrain skillopt`**](docs/tutorials/improving-skills-with-skillopt.md) — treat a `SKILL.md` as a trainable parameter.

## What it does (the loop)

```
  signal   →   search   →   respond   →   write   →   auto-link   →   sync
  (every    (brain-first  (informed     (page +    (typed edges     (cron
  message)  retrieval)    by context)   timeline)  + backlinks)     keeps fresh)
```

- **Signal detector** runs on every message your agent receives. Captures ideas, entity mentions, time-sensitive todos, names, links.
- **Brain-first lookup** before any external API call. The cheapest, fastest, most personal information source you have.
- **Auto-link** fires on every page write. No LLM calls; pure pattern matching on `[[wiki/people/bob]]` style references. New entity → new page stub → graph grows.
- **Cron-driven enrichment** runs while you sleep: dedup people pages, fix citations, score salience, find contradictions, prep tomorrow's tasks.

The whole loop is described in [`docs/architecture/topologies.md`](docs/architecture/topologies.md) with diagrams.

## Capabilities

**Hybrid search.** Vector (HNSW on pgvector) + BM25 keyword + reciprocal-rank fusion + source-tier boost + intent-aware query rewriting. Three named search modes (`conservative`, `balanced`, `tokenmax`) bundle the cost/quality knobs into a single config key. Live cost/recall comparisons in [`docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md). The install picker default-applies `tokenmax` (it recommends `conservative` for Haiku-class subagent tiers or keyless setups); a brain with `search.mode` unset resolves to `balanced` at query time. The cross-encoder reranker is on in `balanced` and `tokenmax`, off in `conservative` — new installs get Voyage `rerank-2.5`; brains that never set `search.reranker.model` still fall back to the deprecated ZeroEntropy `zerank-2` (hosted API ends 2026-09-04) until the September cutover. Per-query graph signals notice when a top result is a hub for THAT query (adjacency boost), is corroborated across team brains (cross-source boost), or is being crowded out by weak chunks from a chatty session (session demote). Run `gbrain search "<query>" --explain` to see per-stage attribution: base score, every boost that fired, what it multiplied. `gbrain doctor` ships a `graph_signals_coverage` check; `gbrain search stats` shows fire counts and failure breakdowns. Vector retrieval pools the best chunk per page, so a page surfaces on its strongest evidence instead of losing to a neighbor on one weak chunk. Queries that match a page's title phrase or a declared free-text alias (`gbrain reindex --aliases` backfills existing pages) get boosted to the page they name. Every result carries an `evidence` tag (why it matched) and a `create_safety` hint (`exists` / `probable` / `unknown`) so an agent decides whether a page already exists instead of guessing from a raw score. `gbrain search diagnose "<query>" --target <slug>` traces which retrieval layer surfaces (or misses) a page.

**Self-wiring knowledge graph.** Every `put_page` extracts entity refs from markdown/wikilinks/typed-link syntax and writes edges with zero LLM calls. Typed edges (`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`, `mentions`, …). Multi-hop traversal via `gbrain graph-query`. The graph is what produces the +31.4 P@5 lift over vector-only RAG. **Obsidian-style vaults:** bare `[[note-name]]` wikilinks that point across folders — you wrote `[[struktura]]` but the page lives at `projects/struktura.md` — resolve by basename once you opt in with `gbrain config set link_resolution.global_basename true`. Off by default; `gbrain doctor` tells you how many edges you'd gain before you flip it. See [migrating an Obsidian vault](INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md#step-45-wire-the-knowledge-graph).

**Job queue (Minions).** BullMQ-shaped, Postgres-native job queue. Durable subagents (LLM tool loops that survive crashes via two-phase pending→done persistence), shell jobs with audit, child jobs with cascading timeouts, rate leases for outbound providers, attachments via S3/Supabase storage. Opt-in per-job process isolation (`gbrain jobs work --job-isolation process`) runs each claimed job in its own SIGKILL-able child process, so a stuck handler dies for real and a crash takes one job instead of the whole worker; when the worker's DB health probe fails, it names the failing layer (`pool_starved` vs `server_unreachable`) instead of a blanket "DB unreachable". Sizing and rollout guidance in [`docs/guides/minions-deployment.md`](docs/guides/minions-deployment.md); probe-verdict triage in [`docs/guides/queue-operations-runbook.md`](docs/guides/queue-operations-runbook.md). Replaces "spawn subagent as fire-and-forget Promise" with something that recovers from anything.

**Non-English brains (FTS language config).** The Postgres full-text search tokenizer is configurable via `GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE`. Defaults to `english`. Set it to any text-search configuration that exists in your Postgres instance:

```bash
export GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE=portuguese     # uses built-in portuguese stemmer
export GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE=spanish        # built-in spanish stemmer
export GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE=pt_br          # custom config (e.g. unaccent + portuguese)
```

List available configs: `psql -c "SELECT cfgname FROM pg_ts_config"`. Both the **query side** (`websearch_to_tsquery`) and the **write side** (the trigger functions that populate `pages.search_vector` and `content_chunks.search_vector`) honor `GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE`. On first install (or upgrade), the `configurable_fts_language` schema migration reads the env var and creates trigger functions in the configured language; subsequent inserts/updates tokenize using that setting. To change language on a brain that has already run the migration, use the dedicated CLI command:

```bash
export GBRAIN_FTS_LANGUAGE=portuguese
gbrain reindex-search-vector --dry-run    # preview row counts
gbrain reindex-search-vector --yes        # recreate triggers + backfill
```

The command is idempotent (re-running with the same language is a no-op for vector content) and uses the same recreate-and-backfill primitives as the migration. For accent-insensitive Portuguese (`pt_br`), see [docs/guides/multi-language-fts.md](docs/guides/multi-language-fts.md) for the `unaccent` + portuguese stemmer recipe.

**50+ curated skills** (the current list lives in [`skills/manifest.json`](skills/manifest.json)). Routing lives in [`skills/RESOLVER.md`](skills/RESOLVER.md). Covers signal capture, ingest (idea / media / meeting), enrichment, querying, brain ops, citation fixing, daily task management, cron scheduling, reports, voice, soul audit, skill creation, eval framework, and migrations. Skills are markdown files (tool-agnostic), packaged as a single skillpack the installer drops into your agent workspace.

**Eval framework.** `gbrain eval longmemeval` runs the public [LongMemEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaowu0162/longmemeval) benchmark against your hybrid retrieval. `gbrain eval export` + `gbrain eval replay` capture real queries and replay them against code changes (set `GBRAIN_CONTRIBUTOR_MODE=1`). `gbrain eval cross-modal` cross-checks an output against the task using three different-provider frontier models. `gbrain eval retrieval-quality` runs NamedThingBench, which hard-gates the named-thing retrieval families (title-substring, alias-synonym, generic-to-named, multi-chunk-dilution) so a regression in "find the page this query names" fails CI loudly. `gbrain eval brainbench` runs the cross-harness memory conformance suite: know-to-ask, push precision/recall, write-back fidelity, and cross-session continuity, scored per harness seam (your OpenClaw's production pipeline plus Claude Code and Codex injection contracts) against a committed 141-fixture synthetic corpus — hermetic by default (in-memory PGLite, no keys, seconds), and CI gates every PR against master's committed baseline. Methodology in [`docs/eval/BRAINBENCH.md`](docs/eval/BRAINBENCH.md); search-mode methodology in [`docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md).

**Brain consistency.** `gbrain eval suspected-contradictions` samples retrieval pairs, layered date pre-filter, query-conditioned LLM judge, persistent cache. Surfaces conflicts between takes + facts the agent has written. Wired into the daily dream cycle.

**Agent-authored schema (v0.40.7.0).** Your brain has a shape — what page types exist (`person`, `meeting`, `paper`, `case`, `lab-result`), what they link to (`attended`, `authored`, `prescribed-by`), what facts get extracted automatically. The default ships with 22 universal types, but your brain's actual shape is not the default shape. Agents can now evolve that shape on your behalf via 14 `gbrain schema` CLI verbs + a batched MCP op (`schema_apply_mutations`, admin scope, NOT localOnly so remote agents reach it over HTTPS). Atomic file locks, audit log with the agent's identity, chunked UPDATE backfill in 1000-row batches that never wedge concurrent writers. The brain stops being a pile of notes and becomes something with structure. **Why it matters:** [`docs/what-schemas-unlock.md`](docs/what-schemas-unlock.md) — 7 killer use cases (4000 invisible meetings, founder ops brain, research brain, legal brain, team brain, agent-as-co-curator). **5-minute walkthrough:** [`docs/schema-author-tutorial.md`](docs/schema-author-tutorial.md). **Agent skill:** [`skills/schema-author/SKILL.md`](skills/schema-author/SKILL.md).

## Integrations

Data flowing into the brain. Each integration is a recipe — markdown + setup hints — that ships in `recipes/` and is discoverable via `gbrain integrations list`.

- **Voice**: Phone calls create brain pages via Twilio + OpenAI Realtime (or DIY STT+LLM+TTS). Setup recipe: [`recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md`](recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md).
- **Email + calendar**: webhook handlers that route to brain signals. [`docs/integrations/meeting-webhooks.md`](docs/integrations/meeting-webhooks.md).
- **Embedding providers**: a dozen providers covered — Voyage (default: `voyage-4` @ 1024d), OpenAI, OpenRouter, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, MiniMax, Alibaba DashScope, Zhipu, Ollama (local), llama.cpp llama-server (local), LiteLLM proxy, plus ZeroEntropy (deprecated — hosted API ends 2026-09-04). Pricing matrix + decision tree in [`docs/integrations/embedding-providers.md`](docs/integrations/embedding-providers.md).
- **Rerankers**: Voyage `rerank-2.5` hosted (the new-install default; reranking is on in `balanced` and `tokenmax` modes, same `VOYAGE_API_KEY` as embeddings), ZeroEntropy `zerank-2` (deprecated — hosted API ends 2026-09-04; still the fallback for brains that never set `search.reranker.model`), plus the `llama-server-reranker` recipe for fully-local cross-encoder rerank via llama.cpp — runs Qwen3-Reranker or self-hosted zerank weights against the same `gateway.rerank()` seam. Setup walkthrough in [`docs/ai-providers/llama-server-reranker.md`](docs/ai-providers/llama-server-reranker.md).
- **Credential gateway**: vault-aware secret distribution. [`docs/integrations/credential-gateway.md`](docs/integrations/credential-gateway.md).
- **MCP clients**: every major MCP client is supported. [`docs/mcp/`](docs/mcp/) per-client setup.

## Architecture

**Two engines, one contract.** PGLite (Postgres 17 via WASM, zero-config, default) for personal brains up to ~50K pages. Postgres + pgvector (Supabase or self-hosted) for shared / large / multi-machine deployments. The contract-first `BrainEngine` interface in [`src/core/engine.ts`](src/core/engine.ts) defines the 140+ methods both engines implement; CLI and MCP server are generated from one source.

**Brain repo is the system of record.** Your knowledge lives in a regular git repo (your "brain repo") as markdown files. GBrain syncs the repo into Postgres for retrieval; deletes in git become soft-deletes in DB. You can publish public subsets, share team mounts, run thin-client setups pointing at a colleague's brain server. Topologies in [`docs/architecture/topologies.md`](docs/architecture/topologies.md).

**Two organizational axes (brain ⊥ source).** A *brain* is a database (your personal brain, a team mount you joined). A *source* is a repo inside that brain (wiki, gstack, an essay, a knowledge base). Routing lives in `.gbrain-source` dotfiles and resolves via a documented 6-tier precedence chain. Full diagrams in [`docs/architecture/brains-and-sources.md`](docs/architecture/brains-and-sources.md).

**Why the graph matters.** Vector search returns chunks that are semantically close. The graph returns chunks that are factually connected. Hybrid search pulls from both; auto-linking on every write keeps the graph fresh. Deep dive: [`docs/architecture/RETRIEVAL.md`](docs/architecture/RETRIEVAL.md).

## Troubleshooting

**PGLite crashes at startup with `RuntimeError: Aborted()` (often right after a macOS upgrade)?** Not a macOS incompatibility — the OS-upgrade reboot killed gbrain mid-write and tore the data dir's WAL. gbrain now repairs this automatically on the next command (data preserved, backup kept); if auto-repair is disabled or skipped, run `gbrain pglite-repair --dry-run` to diagnose and `gbrain pglite-repair --yes` to repair in place. Full recovery ladder (repair → rebuild → engine switch) in [`docs/ENGINES.md` — Troubleshooting: startup abort](docs/ENGINES.md#troubleshooting-startup-abort-runtimeerror-aborted) and [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md#pglite-crashes-on-macos-26x-tahoe).

**`gbrain import` fails with `expected N dimensions, not M`?** Run `gbrain doctor`. It will print the exact `gbrain config set ...` or `gbrain migrate embeddings` command to repair the mismatch. You should not need to delete `~/.gbrain`. Fresh `gbrain init --pglite` auto-detects your embedding provider from API keys: set `VOYAGE_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / another provider key) in the environment — or in `~/.gbrain/config.json`, which init also reads — before running init, or pass `--embedding-model <provider>:<model>` explicitly. With multiple keys set, init fires an interactive picker (non-TTY auto-picks the Voyage default when its key is present). With no keys at all, init continues keyless (keyword-only search) with a loud notice; add a key later and re-run `gbrain init --force --embedding-model voyage:voyage-4` to enable embeddings, or pass `--no-embedding` up front to make keyless explicit. See [`docs/integrations/embedding-providers.md`](docs/integrations/embedding-providers.md) for the full provider matrix and [`docs/operations/headless-install.md`](docs/operations/headless-install.md) for Docker/CI sequencing.

**Hourly cron sync keeps timing out on a federated brain?** Switch your
cron to a per-source loop with shell `timeout(1)` doing the OS-level kill
and gbrain self-terminating gracefully half-a-minute earlier:

```bash
gbrain sync --break-lock --all --max-age 1800
for src in $(gbrain sources list --json | jq -r '.[].id'); do
  timeout 600 gbrain sync --source "$src" --timeout 540 || true
done
```

When `--timeout` fires mid-import, `gbrain sync` exits 0 with status
`partial` and `last_commit` UNCHANGED — the next run re-walks the same
diff and `content_hash` short-circuits already-imported files. The
`--max-age 1800` first command self-heals any wedged-but-alive locks
left by a hung previous run, keyed on the lock's last refresh time
(NOT when it was acquired) so healthy long-running holders are safe by
construction. Scope note: the extract + embed phases still run to
completion once started; `--timeout` interrupts the import walk only.

**Dream cycle silently losing wiki links on Supabase?** The engine
self-retries every bulk batch write (`addLinksBatch` /
`addTimelineEntriesBatch` / `upsertChunks`) on Supavisor pooler blips,
with a 12s worst-case wait that covers the full 5-10s circuit-breaker
recovery window. `gbrain doctor` surfaces incidents via the
`batch_retry_health` check (reads the last 24h of
`~/.gbrain/audit/batch-retry-YYYY-Www.jsonl`). To tune for an unusually
slow pooler:

```bash
# Defaults: 3 retries, base 1s, max 10s, decorrelated jitter.
# Override per operator without a release:
export GBRAIN_BULK_MAX_RETRIES=5       # int >= 0; 0 disables retries
export GBRAIN_BULK_RETRY_BASE_MS=2000  # int > 0
export GBRAIN_BULK_RETRY_MAX_MS=15000  # int >= base
```

Bad values surface at `gbrain doctor` startup with a paste-ready fix
(not at first-retry mid-cycle). PGLite-only installs pay zero cost — the
retry wrap is engine-level, but PGLite has no pooler so retries never
fire in practice.

**Dream cycle losing ~150 link rows per run with `'No database
connection: connect() has not been called'` errors in the log?** The
retry layer self-heals on a nulled-out database singleton: a
`reconnect` callback on `withRetry` rebuilds the connection between
attempts, and `PostgresEngine.batchRetry` injects `() => this.reconnect()`
so engine-level batch writes survive a mid-cycle disconnect by something
else in the same process. `gbrain capture` also no longer trails a
`'No database connection'` stderr line from a background facts:absorb
worker firing after CLI exit — op dispatch awaits
`getFactsQueue().drainPending({timeout: 1000})` before
`engine.disconnect()`. To find which code path is still calling
disconnect mid-process, run `gbrain doctor --json | jq '.checks[] |
select(.id=="batch_retry_health")'`; the check surfaces the
24h disconnect-call count and the most-recent caller frame from the
`~/.gbrain/audit/db-disconnect-YYYY-Www.jsonl` audit.

**`gbrain brainstorm` returning `judge_failed: true` with 0 scored
ideas?** Two historical bugs caused it, both fixed: the judge
hard-coded a 4K-token output cap (any run past ~40 ideas truncated
mid-JSON and the parser threw), and slash-form model ids
(`gbrain brainstorm --judge-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
--max-cost 5`) failed with `BudgetExhausted reason=no_pricing` because
pricing lookups only matched the colon form. Both shapes work now. No
config change, no schema migration — `gbrain upgrade` is the whole fix.

**`gbrain reindex --markdown` wiped your auto/dream/signal-detector
tags?** Upgrade — tag reconciliation is add-only now. Re-import and
`reindex --markdown` ADD current frontmatter tags and never delete,
so enrichment tags written to the DB (auto-tag, dream synthesize,
signal-detector) survive a re-chunk. The reindex DB-only fallback also
reconstructs the full markdown (frontmatter + body + timeline) before
re-chunking, so a page with no on-disk source keeps its frontmatter,
title, and timeline instead of getting overwritten with empty
frontmatter. Trade-off: removing a tag from a page's frontmatter no
longer removes it from the DB on the next sync (frontmatter-tag removal
needs a provenance column, deferred).

**`gbrain sync` wedges on a large brain (no progress, high CPU)?**
Three tools. First, name the stalling file:

```bash
GBRAIN_SYNC_TRACE=1 gbrain sync --no-pull --no-embed --yes
```

The last `[sync] begin import: <path>` line with no following completion
is the file being processed when the hang hit. Second, if you suspect a
schema-pack `inference.regex` with catastrophic backtracking, complete
the sync with the pack disabled and re-run extraction later:

```bash
gbrain sync --no-schema-pack --no-pull --no-embed --yes
```

`gbrain schema lint` warns on the classic nested-quantifier ReDoS
shapes (`(a+)+`, `(a*)*`, …) in pack regexes, and the runtime caps
inference-regex input length (override via `GBRAIN_MAX_REGEX_INPUT_CHARS`).
Third, on a PGLite brain with a live `gbrain serve` (your agent's MCP
server), `gbrain sync` delegates the run to the serve process over its
local IPC socket — the lock owner does the work, your agent stays up,
and Ctrl-C aborts to a checkpoint the next sync resumes from. Embeds
defer to the serve's background sweep. See
[`docs/architecture/serve-sync-concurrency.md`](docs/architecture/serve-sync-concurrency.md)
for the limits (unsupported flags, `serve --http`) and the full triage.

**`gbrain init --migrate-only` / a schema migration fails on Windows
with `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND`?** Upgrade — schema bring-up now runs its
phases in-process instead of spawning a child `gbrain init
--migrate-only` per phase. The spawned child died on
Windows + bun + Supabase pooler with a DNS-resolution failure even
though the parent connected fine; running in-process removes the spawn
entirely. The grandfather migration that used to hang 70+ minutes on an
80K-page PGLite brain also runs as a chunked bulk SQL pass now (keyed on
the page PK, soft-delete-filtered, source-safe) and completes in seconds.
