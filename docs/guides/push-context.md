# Push-based context

Pull retrieval needs the agent to *know to ask* before the brain contributes
anything. Push-based context adds the other direction: the brain volunteers
relevant pages from the recent conversation, confidence-gated so push noise
never becomes worse than pull silence.

The push channels share one zero-LLM core (`src/core/context/volunteer.ts`):

| Channel | Surface | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `reflex` | automatic, inside the context engine | default-on for plugin hosts; nothing to call |
| `op` | `gbrain volunteer-context` / MCP `volunteer_context` | agents without the plugin; one call per turn |
| `watch` | `gbrain watch` | stream a transcript in, volunteered pages stream out |
| `claude-code` / `codex` / `opencode` | `gbrain hook user-prompt` (registered by `gbrain bootstrap`) | per-prompt injection inside a harness; see "Harness hooks" below |

Push context is READ-side. Its WRITE-side sibling — the opt-in ambient
memory writeback channel (`gbrain hook stop` banking gated user turns for
serve-side extraction, `memory.auto_writeback`) — is documented in
[ambient-writeback.md](./ambient-writeback.md).

## How it decides

1. **Extract** entities across the last N turns (capitalized runs, `@handles`),
   merged with recency / frequency / user-role salience. Assistant-introduced
   entities and "what did she invest in?" follow-ups whose antecedent was named
   in the window resolve.
2. **Resolve** through the alias table, exact titles, surnames, and slug
   suffixes — each arm carries an honest confidence: alias 0.9, exact title
   0.8, surname 0.72, slug-suffix 0.6, +0.05 when mentioned in ≥2 turns or the
   newest turn. Lowercase mentions ("remind me what alice said") probe the
   alias table only, and only when the alias is unique across every source in
   play; a surname-only reference ("Did Galewright follow up?") resolves when
   exactly one person page carries that surname. Ambiguity in either arm
   injects nothing — silence beats a wrong pointer. Kill switch for both:
   `retrieval_reflex_lexical_arms` (default on).
3. **Gate** at `min_confidence` (default 0.7 — slug-suffix matches need an
   explicit lower gate), suppress pages already surfaced (slug-presence only),
   cap at 3 pages (hard cap 5).

## CLI

```bash
# one-shot: pipe recent turns (oldest → newest)
printf 'user: ask alice-example about the deal\nassistant: noted\nuser: what did she say?\n' \
  | gbrain volunteer-context

# streaming: volunteered pages print as the transcript flows
some-transcript-feed | gbrain watch --json

# the feedback loop: how often were volunteered pages actually opened?
gbrain volunteer-context --stats
```

Stats are **approximate** by design: "used" means `pages.last_retrieved_at >
volunteered_at` — the 5-minute last-retrieved throttle causes false negatives
and unrelated reads of the same page cause false positives. Use the per-arm
precision to tune `min_confidence`, not as an exact metric.

**PGLite + `gbrain watch`:** PGLite is single-connection, and watch holds its
connection for the whole session — a concurrent `gbrain serve` or any write
path blocks until watch exits. On a PGLite brain, run watch in bursts (piped
input exits at EOF) or use the ambient reflex channel instead, which routes
through a running serve's resolve socket rather than taking the lock. Routing
watch through that same socket is a filed follow-up (TODOS.md). Postgres
brains are unaffected.

## Harness hooks (the prompt-time channel)

`gbrain bootstrap` registers `gbrain hook user-prompt` as a Claude Code
`UserPromptSubmit` hook: every prompt is assembled into a per-turn context
block (reflex pointers + volunteered pages + hot facts) through a running
serve's IPC socket and injected as `additionalContext`. Two properties make
this channel production-grade rather than spammy-and-invisible:

- **Cross-turn dedupe.** The hook reads its OWN previous injections back out
  of the session transcript (Claude Code records them as structured
  `hook_additional_context` attachments; only gbrain-marked blocks count) and
  passes them as prior context — so a page is volunteered once per session,
  not once per mention. The dedupe horizon is bounded (the recent transcript
  window, byte-capped), so a marathon session can eventually re-volunteer its
  oldest injections. The extraction is structural, never substring matching
  over raw turn text, so a short slug appearing in a tool payload can't
  over-suppress.
- **The feedback loop.** The serve logs each DELIVERED block's volunteered
  pages and pointers to `context_volunteer_events` under the hook's channel
  (`claude-code` by default; a codex hook registration passes
  `--harness codex` / `--harness opencode`). `gbrain volunteer-context --stats` then shows
  per-harness precision, and `gbrain doctor`'s `volunteer_channels` check
  shows which channels actually fire, with guidance for the two quiet cases:
  "hook installed but never registered (restart the session)" and "registered
  but quiet". Logging happens at the delivery point only — a block abandoned
  before the serve responded is never counted — and because a delivered
  response still isn't proof of injection (the hook can trim or drop it
  client-side), the doctor check reconciles the counts against the hook's own
  heartbeat and cautions when they diverge.

The hook lane rides the PGLite serve's IPC socket: on a Postgres brain or a
thin-client install the hook stays quiet by design (pull-mode retrieval covers
those; extending the lane is a filed follow-up in TODOS.md).

Kill switch: `GBRAIN_HOOKS=0`. Install/uninstall: `docs/guides/bootstrap.md`.

## The OpenClaw reflex volunteer arm

The OpenClaw context-engine lane's ambient reflex runs TWO arms per
windowed turn: Arm 1 resolves entity pointers (the classic 3-pointer block),
then Arm 2 runs the same `volunteerStage` gate the Claude Code turn-context
lane ships — up to 3 additional confidence-gated pages (0.7 gate), deduped
against the turn's pointers, rendered in the same wire idiom. Volunteer
events from this lane log to `context_volunteer_events` under the `openclaw`
channel (in-process only — the wire-claimable harness channel allowlist
deliberately excludes it, so a hook client cannot spoof production
attribution; on the PGLite/IPC rung these events are not logged; extending the
log to that rung is a filed follow-up in TODOS.md).

**Say to your agent:** *"Turn off the brain's volunteered context for now"* —
your agent sets `retrieval_reflex_volunteer` to `false` (or exports
`GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX_VOLUNTEER=off` when config is unreachable — env wins
over config as the incident lever). *"How often are volunteered pages actually
used?"* — your agent runs `gbrain volunteer-context --stats`.

## Config

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `retrieval_reflex_window_turns` | 4 | turns the ambient reflex extracts from; 1 = current turn only (file/env plane: `GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX_WINDOW_TURNS`) |
| `retrieval_reflex` | true | the ambient channel's master switch (env: `GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX`; negatives `false/0/off/no`, case-insensitive) |
| `retrieval_reflex_volunteer` | true | the reflex volunteer arm (Arm 2) — the incident kill switch for volunteered pages on the OpenClaw lane (env: `GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX_VOLUNTEER`, env above config) |
| `retrieval_reflex_max_pointers` | 3 | pointer cap per turn |
| `retrieval_reflex_lexical_arms` | true | the lowercase-alias + surname recall arms (env: `GBRAIN_RETRIEVAL_REFLEX_LEXICAL_ARMS`); off = disables both arms |

Per-call knobs: `max_pages` + `min_confidence` on both the op and `gbrain watch`
(`--max-pages` / `--min-confidence`, plus `--window-turns` / `--source` on watch);
on the op only: `prior_context` (text whose already-surfaced slugs are suppressed),
`session_id` / `turn` attribution params (watch stamps its own per-session id and
turn numbers in the feedback log), and `days` to size the `--stats` window.

## Storage + privacy

Volunteered pages log to `context_volunteer_events` (migration v117): slug,
arm, confidence, channel, optional session/turn — the rationale is a
deterministic template string, never raw conversation text. Event writes are
best-effort (fire-and-forget, drained at CLI exit) — the log is a tuning signal,
not an audit trail. Rows are pruned after 90 days by the dream cycle's purge
phase. Synopses always strip the takes/facts fences — the same strip `get_page`
applies to untrusted callers, applied unconditionally here so private fence rows
never reach a prompt regardless of caller trust.
