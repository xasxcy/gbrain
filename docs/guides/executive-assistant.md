# Executive Assistant Pattern

## Goal
Email triage, meeting prep, and scheduling powered by brain context -- so every interaction is informed by the full history of the relationship.

## What the User Gets
Without this: the agent triages email mechanically ("you have 12 unread"), preps for meetings with generic LinkedIn bios, and schedules without relationship context. With this: the agent knows who every sender is before reading their email, surfaces shared history before every meeting, and nudges scheduling based on relationship temperature and open threads.

## Implementation

**Native pieces:** the email half of this pattern needs no hand-rolled
collection or thread tracking. The google connector ingests Gmail/Calendar/
Contacts (`docs/guides/google-connect.md`) and the open-loop engine
(`docs/guides/open-loops.md`) maintains real loop rows behind `gbrain waiting`
and the `open_loops` op. `context.open_threads` in the workflows below is
backed by those rows — entity cards carry `direction`, `due`, and `loop_id`
per thread. The daily-operation contract lives in `skills/google-loops/SKILL.md`.

Before hand-rolling these: gbrain bundles the morning-briefing half of this
pattern as the `briefing` skill (`skills/briefing/`) and the task-prep half
as `daily-task-prep` (`skills/daily-task-prep/`). Use the workflows below to
extend or customize what those skills already ship.

```
# WORKFLOW 1: Email Triage
on email_batch(emails):
    # Step 0: Load the open-loop state FIRST — who is already waiting on you
    #   (real loop rows: deterministic thread detector + commitment extractor)
    waiting = gbrain waiting --json     # or the open_loops op over MCP
    #   Refuses on stale google sources by design — run the sync it names first

    for email in emails:
        # Step 1: Search sender BEFORE reading the email body
        #   Brain context makes triage 10x better
        sender_page = gbrain search "{email.sender_name}"
        if sender_page:
            context = gbrain get <sender_slug>
            #   Now you know: who they are, relationship history,
            #   what they care about, open threads
            #   context.open_threads entries are backed by loop rows and
            #   carry direction ("owed_by_me"/"owed_to_me"), due, loop_id

        # Step 2: Read the email WITH brain context loaded
        #   Classification is now informed, not mechanical

        # Step 3: Classify with context
        if context.relationship == "inner_circle" or sender in waiting.counterparties:
            priority = "urgent"     # they're already waiting on the user
        elif context.is_known_entity:
            priority = "normal"
        else:
            priority = "noise"  # unknown sender, no brain page

        # Step 4: Draft reply with relationship context
        if needs_reply(email):
            draft = compose_reply(
                email,
                context=context,           # their brain page
                open_threads=context.open_threads,  # loop-backed: what's owed, by whom, due when
                relationship=context.relationship   # tone calibration
            )
        # After the user sends a reply, the loop closes itself on the next
        # sync (closed_by: reply_detected); commitments close via
        # `gbrain loops done <loop_id>`

# WORKFLOW 2: Meeting Prep
on upcoming_meeting(meeting):
    briefing = {}
    for attendee in meeting.attendees:
        # Search brain for each attendee
        results = gbrain search "{attendee.name}"
        if results:
            page = gbrain get <attendee_slug>
            briefing[attendee] = {
                "compiled_truth": page.compiled_truth,
                "last_interaction": page.timeline[0],     # most recent
                "open_threads": page.open_threads,
                "relationship_temperature": page.relationship,
                "relevant_deals": gbrain call get_links '{"slug": "<attendee_slug>"}',
            }
        else:
            briefing[attendee] = "No brain page -- consider enriching"

    # Surface: shared history, what to follow up on, what to watch for
    # "Last time you discussed the Series B timeline. alice-example was
    #  concerned about burn rate. Here's the latest from her company page."

# WORKFLOW 3: Post-Inbox Brain Updates
on inbox_cleared():
    for email in processed_emails:
        if email.contained_new_information:
            # Update the sender's brain page with new signal
            gbrain timeline-add <sender_slug> {date} \
                "Email re: {subject}. Key info: {extracted_signal}" \
                --source "email from {sender} re {subject}, {date}"

            # Update any mentioned entity pages too
            for entity in email.mentioned_entities:
                gbrain timeline-add <entity_slug> {date} \
                    "{what_was_said_about_them}" \
                    --source "email from {sender}, {date}"

# WORKFLOW 4: Scheduling Nudges
on schedule_request(meeting):
    # The ranked source of truth for "who is owed what" is the loop engine:
    waiting = gbrain waiting --json     # top counterparties, due dates, evidence

    for attendee in meeting.attendees:
        page = gbrain get <attendee_slug>
        if page.last_interaction > 6_weeks_ago:
            nudge("You haven't met with {attendee} in {weeks} weeks")
        for thread in page.open_threads:      # loop-backed entries
            if thread.direction == "owed_by_me":
                nudge("You owe {attendee}: {thread.summary} (due {thread.due})")
            else:
                nudge("{attendee} owes you: {thread.summary} — worth raising in the meeting")
        if page.relationship_temperature == "cooling":
            nudge("Relationship with {attendee} may need attention")
        # When a nudge is resolved in the meeting, close it:
        #   gbrain loops done <thread.loop_id>
```

## Tricky Spots

1. **Search sender BEFORE reading the email.** This is counterintuitive but critical. Loading brain context first means you know who they are, what you're working on together, and what they care about -- before you even see the subject line. The triage is informed, not mechanical.
2. **Unknown senders with no brain page are almost always noise.** If `gbrain search` returns nothing for a sender, they're probably not important. Classify as low priority unless the email content signals otherwise.
3. **Meeting prep is the highest-leverage EA workflow.** The user walks into every meeting already briefed on each attendee: last interaction, open threads, relationship history. This is the difference between "you have a meeting at 3" and "you have a meeting at 3 with alice-example -- last time you discussed the Series B, she was concerned about burn rate."
4. **Post-inbox brain updates are where the brain compounds.** Every email is signal. If you clear the inbox without updating brain pages, the information is lost. This is the step most agents skip.
5. **Scheduling nudges require timeline data.** "You haven't met with charlie-example in 6 weeks" only works if meeting pages have been ingested with proper entity propagation (see meeting-ingestion guide).

## How to Verify

1. Run meeting prep for tomorrow's calendar. For each attendee, confirm the agent ran `gbrain search` and loaded their brain page before generating the briefing.
2. Triage 5 emails. Confirm the agent searched for each sender in the brain before classifying the email.
3. After clearing an inbox, check 2 sender brain pages with `gbrain get <slug>`. Confirm new timeline entries were added with information from the emails.
4. Check a scheduling suggestion. Confirm the agent referenced the attendee's brain page (last interaction date, open threads) in the nudge.
5. Send a test email from someone with a brain page. Confirm the triage response references their relationship context, not just the email content.
