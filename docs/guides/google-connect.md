# Connecting Google (Gmail, Calendar, Contacts)

gbrain's google connector ingests your Gmail threads, calendar events, and
contacts into your brain and runs the [open-loop engine](open-loops.md) on
top: *who is waiting on you, what you promised, and the context needed to
respond.*

Everything is **bring-your-own OAuth**: you create your own (free) Google
Cloud OAuth client, so you own the app, the quota, and the tokens. Tokens
live only in your local credential vault (`~/.gbrain/credentials.json`,
mode 0600). The connector is read-only — it never writes to your Google
account (`gmail.readonly`, `calendar.readonly`, `contacts.readonly`).

## The fast path (one command)

```bash
gbrain google setup
```

`setup` walks the whole chain idempotently: guided credential intake →
consent → source registration → a first sync (newest mail first, budgeted so
it finishes fast; the deep backfill resumes automatically on later syncs) →
your first `gbrain waiting` digest. Re-running it is always safe — it
detects what's done and continues.

The pieces, if you want them separately:

```bash
gbrain google connect                 # credentials + consent only
gbrain sources add gmail-you --kind google --account you@example.com
gbrain sync --source gmail-you
gbrain waiting
```

## One-time Google Cloud setup (~7 minutes)

You need a Desktop-app OAuth client in your own Google Cloud project.
`gbrain google connect` prints this exact checklist when no credentials are
on file:

1. Create (or pick) a project: <https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate>
2. Enable the three APIs (one click each):
   - Gmail: <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com>
   - Calendar: <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com>
   - Contacts (People): <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com>
3. Configure the consent screen: <https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview>
   - **Google Workspace account** → user type **Internal**. Done — no
     verification, tokens never expire weekly.
   - **Personal gmail.com** → user type **External**, then BOTH:
     a. add your own email as a **Test user** (<https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience>), and
     b. click **Publish app** on that same page. *Skipping this makes Google
     silently revoke your tokens every 7 days* — the single most common
     failure in the wild.
4. Create the OAuth client: <https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients>
   — application type **Desktop app** (NOT "Web application").
5. Click **Download JSON**.

Then:

```bash
gbrain google connect --client-json ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json
```

You can also paste the JSON contents on stdin (`--client-json -`), export
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, or type the pair at the prompt.
Pasted values are sanitized (smart quotes, stray whitespace) and validated
by shape before anything talks to Google.

gbrain records the scopes Google *actually granted* (the consent screen lets
you uncheck scopes), so a narrower-than-needed grant surfaces immediately as
`scope_missing` with the reauth fix attached — never as opaque per-sweep 403s.

During consent Google shows **"Google hasn't verified this app."** That is
YOUR app — click *Advanced → Continue*.

## Headless / SSH / agent-on-another-machine

The connector auto-detects environments where a local browser can't open
(SSH, WSL, containers, no display) and switches to **paste-back mode**: it
prints the consent URL; you open it anywhere, approve, and the browser fails
to load a `http://127.0.0.1:41999/...` page — that's expected. Copy that
page's full address-bar URL and paste it back (interactive prompt), or
complete non-interactively:

```bash
gbrain google connect --paste          # prints the URL, stores flow state
gbrain google connect --code "http://127.0.0.1:41999/?code=...&state=..."
```

Force it anytime with `--paste` or `GBRAIN_FORCE_PASTE=1`.

Note: Google's device-code flow is **not** an option — Gmail/Calendar/
Contacts scopes are excluded from it by Google. Loopback + paste-back is the
supported path.

## Multiple accounts

Repeat `gbrain google connect --account work@yourco.com` per account; each
account becomes its own source (`gbrain sources add gmail-work --kind google
--account work@yourco.com`) with independent sync cursors and locks.

## Secondary calendars

The calendar sweep reads ONE calendar per source (so each keeps its own
incremental sync token) and defaults to the account's primary calendar.
Shared, subscribed, and secondary calendars the granted `calendar.readonly`
scope already covers are ingested by pointing an additional source at them:

```bash
gbrain google calendars                 # list every calendar the account can
                                        # read (* marks the primary), with ids
gbrain google calendars --json          # { ok, status, account, calendars[],
                                        #   next_action.command } for agents
gbrain sources add family-cal --kind google --account you@example.com \
  --services calendar --calendar-id "family0123456789@group.calendar.google.com"
```

**Say to your agent:** *"list the calendars my google account can read"* —
*"ingest my family calendar into the brain"* (your agent runs
`gbrain google calendars`, then `gbrain sources add … --calendar-id <id>`).

Each source's incremental sync token is bound to the calendar it was minted
for. Re-pointing an existing source at a different calendar (its
`g_calendar_id` config key) is safe: the next sweep notices the change, logs
`[google] calendar changed (<old> → <new>)`, discards the old cursor, and
re-lists the new calendar from a fresh window instead of replaying the old
calendar's delta. Pages already imported from the previous calendar stay in
the brain until you remove them — they are not reconciled automatically.

## Continuous sync

Google sources are ordinary gbrain sources: `gbrain sync --source <id>`,
`gbrain sync --all`, autopilot, and the dream cycle all pick them up. A bare
un-targeted `gbrain sync` (repo mode) does not — target it or use `--all`.
Health: `gbrain google status` (live refresh probe per account) and
`gbrain doctor` (the `google_oauth` check warns once a Testing-mode account
goes 5+ days without a successful refresh — note an account that refreshes
daily gets no pre-warning before Google kills Testing-mode tokens at day 7;
publishing to Production is the real fix). Once you publish the app to
Production, record it by re-running consent —
`gbrain google connect --reauth <email> --consent-state production` — so the
weekly-expiry warning stops firing. Less-common flags
(`--via`, `--no-browser`, `--no-probe`, `--purge-client`, and setup's
`--history-days` / `--sync-budget-ms`): `gbrain google --help`. The `--via`
hosted fast path (a verified OAuth client brokering consent, tokens still
stored locally) is feature-gated off until the relay server exists; its full
design lives at
[`docs/designs/HOSTED_OAUTH_RELAY.md`](../designs/HOSTED_OAUTH_RELAY.md).

Sync freshness is honest by construction: the GMAIL sweep's success gates the
source's synced stamp (it protects loop freshness — the thing `gbrain
waiting`'s staleness gate exists to guard); contacts/calendar failures mark
the run partial without blocking it. A single thread that repeatedly fails to fetch is skipped after a few
consecutive failures instead of wedging the sync forever;
`gbrain sync --source <id> --full` retries skipped threads with a fresh
ledger.

## Other ways to reach Google (no gbrain OAuth)

If your stack already holds Google access another way — a Google CLI with its
own auth store, `gcloud`, or a credential gateway that can mint short-lived
access tokens — the source can use it directly and skip gbrain's OAuth flow
entirely. `--account` stays required as the IDENTITY (it drives "is this
message mine" loop direction and the Gmail deep links' `authuser`); no
credential is stored in gbrain for these modes.

**Say to your agent:** *"connect my gmail through my existing Google CLI —
your agent runs `gbrain sources add <id> --kind google --access command
--token-command \"<your token command>\" --account <email>`"*

```bash
# Any command that prints an access token (bare token, or JSON with a
# token/access_token field and optional expiry/expires_in). gbrain runs it
# at sync time and caches the token until it expires; it never stores it.
gbrain sources add gmail-work --kind google --account you@example.com \
  --access command --token-command "gcloud auth print-access-token"

# Or read a live token from an env var refreshed by something outside gbrain
# (a gateway sidecar, a cron job). The var NAME goes in config, never a value.
gbrain sources add gmail-work --kind google --account you@example.com \
  --access env --token-env GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

What changes vs the vault flow: `gbrain google status`'s refresh probe and
`gbrain doctor`'s `google_oauth` check cover vault accounts only (your
external tool owns token health); the scope preflight trusts `--services`
(a token missing a scope surfaces as `api_not_enabled`/`upstream` per sweep
instead of `scope_missing`); send-as aliases are fetched live when the token
allows it, otherwise identity degrades to the account address alone. The
token command runs locally at sync time with your shell — it lives in local
source config, is never reachable over MCP, and is the same trust class as a
recipe health-check command. Failures surface as `access_command_failed` /
`access_env_missing` with the fix attached.

## Troubleshooting

Every failure the connector can hit maps to a typed error with the fix
attached. The catalog (also emitted as structured JSON with `--json`):

| Code | What happened | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `client_json_wrong_type` | The downloaded JSON is a **Web application** client (top-level `"web"` key) | Create a **Desktop app** client and download its JSON |
| `client_json_unreadable` | The client JSON path doesn't exist or isn't the Google Cloud download | Re-download from Credentials → your Desktop app client → Download JSON, pass with `--client-json <path>` |
| `client_shape_invalid` | Pasted ID/secret malformed (smart quotes, truncation) | Re-copy, or use `--client-json` |
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Google rejected the redirect | Almost always a Web-type client — use a Desktop app client |
| `access_denied_test_user` | Consent blocked (External + Testing, you're not a test user — or you clicked Cancel) | Add yourself under Audience → Test users, retry the same URL |
| `pasted_wrong_url` | You pasted the consent-page URL | Approve first, then paste the `http://127.0.0.1...` address-bar URL |
| `state_mismatch` | The paste came from an older attempt | Re-run connect, use the fresh URL |
| `admin_policy_enforced` | Workspace admin blocks third-party apps (even your own client) | Admin console → Security → API controls → trust the app; or make the consent screen Internal |
| `wrong_account_consented` | A different Google account approved | Re-run; the URL now pre-selects the right account |
| `port_in_use` | Loopback port taken | Re-run (fresh ephemeral port), `--port <n>`, or `--paste` |
| `consent_timeout` | Consent never completed within 10 minutes | Re-run connect |
| `invalid_grant_testing_expiry` | Refresh token dead ≈7 days after connect | Publish the app to Production, then `gbrain google connect --reauth <email>` |
| `invalid_grant_revoked` | Access revoked (password change, manual revoke, client rotated) | `gbrain google connect --reauth <email>` |
| `invalid_grant_clock_skew` | Your system clock is off by >60s | Fix time sync, retry |
| `code_reused` | Authorization code used twice | Re-run connect (codes are single-use) |
| `invalid_client` | Client secret rotated/deleted in the console | Download the current JSON, reconnect |
| `no_refresh_token` | Google returned no refresh token | Re-run connect; if persistent, revoke at <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions> and reconnect |
| `api_not_enabled` | An API isn't enabled in your project | The error carries the exact enable link (project pre-selected) |
| `rate_limited` | Google quota hit | Automatic backoff; nothing to do |
| `scope_missing` | Connected with narrower `--scopes` than needed | `gbrain google connect --reauth <email>` |
| `relay_unreachable` / `relay_session_expired` / `claim_already_used` / `relay_disabled` | Hosted fast-path (gbrain.io relay) issues | BYO connect always works: `gbrain google connect` |
| `not_connected` | No vault entry for the account | `gbrain google connect` |
| `upstream` | Google returned an unexpected error | Retry; if it persists, run `gbrain google status --json` and file the output |
| `access_command_failed` | The `--access command` token command exited non-zero, timed out, or printed nothing token-shaped | Run it by hand; it must print a bare token or JSON with `token`/`access_token` |
| `access_env_missing` | The `--access env` variable is unset/blank in this process | Export a live token into it (refresh externally), or switch back to the vault flow |

Cursor expiries (`historyId` older than ~a week, calendar/contacts
`syncToken` 410) are handled automatically with bounded re-lists — never
user-facing.

## Custody, privacy, spend

- Tokens: local vault only, 0600, atomic writes. `sources.config` stores an
  account *pointer*, never a secret. `gbrain creds list` is always redacted.
- Disconnect: `gbrain google disconnect <email>` removes local tokens; revoke
  Google-side at <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions>.
- Upgrade/transfer: `gbrain creds export` produces a passphrase-encrypted
  bundle (a loud per-credential warning when a Testing-mode consent screen
  would travel with it — those tokens die within 7 days on the target).
- LLM spend: commitment extraction sends recent email text (last 30 days,
  capped per sweep) to your configured chat provider. Kill switch:
  `gbrain config set loops.extraction_enabled false`. The deterministic
  unanswered-thread detector is free and always on.

## For agents ([SHOW USER] protocol)

Every `gbrain google`/`creds`/`waiting` command supports `--json` and emits
`{ ok, status, next_action: { command?, user_message? }, error? }`. Human
copy the harness should relay verbatim is fenced in `[SHOW USER]` blocks.
The whole setup is exactly two user interactions: (1) the GCP checklist +
client JSON hand-back, (2) one consent click. Never pass secrets via argv —
use `--client-json <path>`, stdin, or env.
