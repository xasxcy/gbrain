# Why the hybrid + graph stack works

Vector search alone underdelivers on real personal-knowledge queries. This doc explains why gbrain layers four strategies together and how they compound.

## The four strategies in concert

1. **Vector (HNSW on pgvector)** — semantic similarity. Catches "who works on retrieval quality at acme-example?" → pages mentioning "alice-example + retrieval" even when the user never typed "acme".
2. **BM25 keyword** — lexical match. Catches names, exact phrases, code identifiers, anything where the user remembers the literal token. Survives the cases where vector search drifts into thematic neighbors.
3. **Reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF)** — merges vector + keyword rankings without weighting one over the other globally. Each strategy gets to vote.
4. **Knowledge graph traversal** — follows typed edges. Catches "what did Bob invest in this quarter?" by walking `bob ── invested_in ──> company ── dated ──> Q1`. Vector search can't see causal chains; the graph can.

## Why each one alone fails

**Vector only.** Returns chunks semantically close to the query. Misses any factual relationship not directly encoded in the embedding. "Companies in alice-example's portfolio" returns essays about portfolios, not company pages.

**Keyword only (ripgrep-style).** Brittle to phrasing. "Who works on retrieval?" misses pages that say "search ranking" instead of "retrieval." Garbage on synonyms, near-misses, or paraphrases.

**Graph only.** Excellent at "neighbors of Alice" but blind to anything not yet linked. Sparse on fresh pages until backlinks accumulate.

**Hybrid (vector + keyword + RRF), no graph.** Decent at "what is X?" type queries. Fails on "what is Y's relationship to X?" — those are graph queries and no amount of embedding tuning recovers them.

## The benchmark

BrainBench (corpus + harness in the sibling [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) repo) measures retrieval P@5, R@5, MRR, nDCG@5 on a 240-page Opus-generated rich-prose corpus. (This is the retrieval-ranking benchmark; the in-repo `gbrain eval brainbench` suite — [`docs/eval/BRAINBENCH.md`](../eval/BRAINBENCH.md) — gates the memory behaviors *above* retrieval: unprompted context push, write-back fidelity, cross-session continuity.)

| Strategy | P@5 | R@5 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ripgrep BM25 only | ~18 | ~75 | Lexical-only baseline |
| vector-only RAG | ~18 | ~80 | Standard RAG implementation |
| gbrain graph-disabled (hybrid + RRF, no graph traversal) | ~18 | ~85 | Hybrid alone |
| **gbrain default (full stack)** | **49.1** | **97.9** | Graph + extract-quality lift |

**+31 P@5 points** from the graph + extract quality work. The graph isn't a marginal feature; it's the load-bearing wall.

## Auto-link: why zero-LLM-call edge extraction works

Every `put_page` runs `extractEntityRefs` on the markdown body. It matches:

- Standard markdown links: `[Alice Example](wiki/people/alice-example)`
- Obsidian wikilinks: `[[wiki/people/alice-example|Alice Example]]`
- Typed-link blockquotes: `> **Convention:** see [path](path).`

Three regexes, zero LLM tokens, single SQL `addLinksBatch` call with `INSERT ... SELECT FROM jsonb_to_recordset(($1::jsonb)->'rows') JOIN pages ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING 1` (free-text-safe). The graph grows on every write at near-zero cost. On a 17K-page brain, full graph extract completes in seconds.

Heuristic link-type inference (`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`) fires from surrounding sentence context — also LLM-free. Power users who want richer types add them via the typed-link blockquote convention.

## Cross-encoder reranker: 60% top-1 reshuffle

The reranker is on for the `balanced` and `tokenmax` mode bundles, off for `conservative`. The mode-bundle default is Voyage `rerank-2.5` (`DEFAULT_RERANKER_MODEL`, same `VOYAGE_API_KEY` as the embedding default); a brain with no `search.reranker.model` row reranks with it. Without the key, search fails open in RRF order: the gateway skips the HTTP call (`RerankError('no_key')`), writes ONE audit row per process, prints nothing, and stamps `reranker_skipped (no_key)` on the search meta — `gbrain search --explain` shows it, `gbrain search modes` prints a `Reranker:` readiness line, and `gbrain doctor`'s `reranker_health` names the fix (`export VOYAGE_API_KEY=…` or `gbrain config set search.reranker.enabled false`). Keyed installs without a Voyage key get reranking explicitly disabled at init. An explicit ZeroEntropy `zerank-*` config (`LEGACY_DEFAULT_RERANKER_MODEL`; hosted API ends 2026-09-04) short-circuits past that date before any HTTP: one audit row per process per model plus a single stderr line naming the switch command, and `gbrain doctor`'s `provider_sunset` check explains the state; a `base_urls` recipe override (self-hosted wire-compatible endpoint) suppresses the short-circuit. The retained query-cache key includes `reranker_model`; persisted result reuse is disabled until every response dependency can be verified. On a real-corpus benchmark across 20 queries, the cross-encoder reshuffled **60% of top-1 results** after the hybrid + RRF + graph stack (measured on zerank-2). The Voyage default's paired LongMemEval numbers live in [`docs/eval-bench.md`](../eval-bench.md#public-benchmarks-longmemeval).

The mechanical reason: hybrid ranking is locally optimal per strategy but globally suboptimal. A cross-encoder reranker reads the query + each candidate document jointly, with full attention. It catches the cases where the vector + keyword + graph signals all agreed on a document that's semantically related but topically wrong.

The cost: +150ms p50 latency, ~$0.025–0.05/M tokens depending on the reranker. Disabled with `gbrain config set search.reranker.enabled false`. For agent loops that do downstream LLM work after retrieval, the latency is invisible.

## Source-aware ranking

Hybrid search applies a source-factor CASE expression at the SQL layer (lives in `src/core/search/sql-ranking.ts`). Curated content like `originals/`, `concepts/`, `writing/` outranks bulk content like `your-openclaw/chat/`, `daily/`, `media/x/`. Hard-exclude prefixes (`test/`, `attachments/`, `.raw/`) filter at retrieval, not post-rank.

`archive/` is deliberately NOT hard-excluded: it holds high-signal historical content users expect to find, so it is demoted (`0.5x` in `DEFAULT_SOURCE_BOOSTS`), not hidden. The demote is a prior applied in the outer SQL re-rank; the cross-encoder reranker (balanced/tokenmax modes) can still PROMOTE an archive page that survives the demote into the rerank candidate window — it is not an unconditional suppression. `gbrain doctor`'s `hidden_by_search_policy` check reports how many chunked pages remain hidden by the surviving exclude prefixes.

The boost map is configurable via the `GBRAIN_SOURCE_BOOST` env var. Hard exclusions are separate: the exclusion set is defaults ∪ `GBRAIN_SEARCH_EXCLUDE` (env, comma-separated prefixes) ∪ per-call `SearchOpts.exclude_slug_prefixes`. Temporal queries (`detail: 'high'`) bypass the boost so chat pages re-surface for time-sensitive lookups.

## Named-thing retrieval (per-page pool + title + alias + evidence)

A brain organized around *chosen names* (project codenames, place nicknames —
say a project named "Helios" whose page is also known as "the Sun Room") needs
more than embedding proximity. Four layers (the failure mode they close is
written up in [`RETRIEVAL_MAXPOOL_INCIDENT.md`](../incidents/RETRIEVAL_MAXPOOL_INCIDENT.md)):

- **Per-page max-pool** — `searchVector` (both engines) collapses chunk-grain
  candidates to the best chunk per page (`DISTINCT ON (slug)`) over the full
  candidate set before the user `LIMIT`, via the shared `buildBestPerPagePoolCte`
  in `sql-ranking.ts`. The vector side returns N distinct pages by best chunk,
  not N chunks that collapse to fewer pages downstream. When one dense page's
  chunks fill the inner candidate pool, the engines escalate the pool in a
  bounded loop (×4 per step, at most 3 escalations; HNSW-backed columns
  additionally cap at the `ef_search` ceiling) until the page count is honest;
  a loop that ends still underfilled surfaces `vector_pool_underfilled` on the
  hybrid layer's `HybridSearchMeta` (the op-layer capture channel) instead of
  silently returning a short page.
- **Title-phrase boost** — when the normalized query is a contiguous token-run
  inside `page.title` (or an exact full-title match), a floor-ratio-gated,
  bounded multiplier fires (`applyTitleBoost`, `search.title_boost` knob). A
  query that is a phrase from the title can't lose to a body chunk by luck.
- **Alias hop** — free-text `aliases:` frontmatter is projected into a
  `page_aliases` table (separate from the `slug_aliases` wikilink redirect) and
  consulted at query time: a full normalized-query match injects/boosts the
  canonical page (`applyAliasHop`). The only layer that bridges true synonyms
  with zero surface overlap ("the Sun Room" → the Helios page). Backfill
  existing pages with `gbrain reindex --aliases`.
- **Evidence contract** — every result carries `evidence`
  (`alias_hit | exact_title_match | high_vector_match | keyword_exact |
  weak_semantic`) and `create_safety` (`exists | probable | unknown`). An agent
  deciding "is this page already here, safe to NOT write a duplicate?" keys off
  `create_safety`, not a raw blended score. `high_vector_match` is grounded in
  the result's real query↔chunk cosine (`SearchResult.cosine` at/above
  `search.evidence_cosine_floor`, default 0.80) — never the blended score, so a
  keyword+boost pile-up can't read as semantic support; keyless runs have no
  cosine and degrade to honest keyword-based labels. `gbrain search --explain`
  prints each result's raw cosine next to its blended score.

**Extraction quarantine lane:** pages carrying the unverified
auto-extracted markers (frontmatter `provenance: auto-extracted` +
`status: unverified`, see `src/core/extraction-review.ts`) rank as ordinary
content — they are skipped by the compiled-truth fusion boost and by the
`people/`/`companies/` namespace source-boost, and every search result from
such a page carries `unverified: true` so agents can label the provenance.
Promote or reject them via `gbrain extraction-pending` / `gbrain
extraction-review`.

The `search` MCP/CLI op is **cheap-hybrid** (vector + keyword + RRF + pool +
title + alias, expansion off); `query` is the full-control variant. Route
concept / landscape / "all-of-X" questions to `query` — expansion recovers
synonym-phrased matches `search` can miss, and a populated `search` result set
is not proof of coverage (both are top-K; exhaustive enumeration belongs to
`list_pages`). NamedThingBench
(`gbrain eval retrieval-quality`) gates these families on every PR. Diagnose a
specific miss with `gbrain search diagnose "<q>" --target <slug>`.

## Intent-aware query rewriting

`src/core/search/query-intent.ts` classifies queries into `entity`, `temporal`, `event`, `concept`, or `general`. Each routes through different ranking knobs:

- **Entity** queries ("who works at X?") apply a higher graph-traversal weight.
- **Temporal** queries ("what happened last week?") bypass source-boost so chat/daily pages surface.
- **Event** queries ("Acme AI Series A") engage the timeline index.
- **Concept** queries ("what is the ownership economy?", "find all the companies doing offshore wind" — definitional paraphrases and landscape/quantifier phrasings with no proper noun) rank vector-lean, so keyword-decoy pages stop outranking the page that actually explains the idea. Proper nouns, quoted phrases, and sub-3-word queries never classify as concept — they keep their existing routing.
- **General** queries hit the standard hybrid stack.

The classifier is deterministic (no LLM call). Wrong classification degrades gracefully — the hybrid stack still works without it.

## Multi-query expansion

For `detail: 'high'` searches, `src/core/search/expansion.ts` runs a Haiku-class LLM call to produce 2-3 query variants. Each variant's vector list enters RRF fusion alongside the original's. Expansion is NOT free on recall: on LongMemEval-S (470 scored questions, k=5, the 2026-09-02 receipt in `docs/eval-bench.md`) plain hybrid scores 93.19% strict `recall_all@5` while hybrid + equal-weight expansion scores 54.89% (paired +3 / -183 questions) — variant lists fusing at the same weight as the original outvote it on small-k recall, and the damage grows with the nondeterministic variant count.

The fix is budget-normalized weighted RRF, composed in `src/core/search/fusion-lists.ts`. Every vector list is a role-tagged arm (`original` | `variant` | `clause` | `image`) — tagged objects, never a positional convention, so a failed arm or a fell-open image branch can't mis-tag a list. The `original` arm always fuses at weight 1; the non-empty `variant`/`clause` arms share ONE total weight budget, `search.expansion_variant_budget` (`weight_i = b / n_voting_arms`, each row scored `weight / (k + rank)`), so total expansion influence is exactly `b` however many variants the LLM produced. `null` — the default in all three mode bundles — is the legacy equal-weight fusion (every list weight 1, byte-identical). A budget in (0, 4] is set with `gbrain config set search.expansion_variant_budget <b>`, per call via `HybridSearchOpts.expansionVariantBudget`, or pinned per eval arm with `gbrain eval longmemeval --expansion-variant-budget <b>` (sweep it against frozen `--expansion-replay` variants so cells differ only in `b`). Arithmetic: two variants agreeing on a distractor at rank 0 tie the original's rank-0 vote exactly at `b = 1.0`; legacy with two variants is ≈ `b = 2.0`; `b = 0.5` subordinates them. The knob is a no-op when expansion is off and folds into the query-cache key (`evb=`). Outcome (ranker wave, 2026-09-06, recorded Haiku variants replayed at every budget): the mechanism is real — strict `recall_all@5` rises from 255/470 at the legacy weighting to 394/470 at budget 0.25 — but its pre-registered rule (≥ plain hybrid − 2 on the 430-question decision set, no type losing > 1) failed at every budget (0.25: −43; plain hybrid 439/470), so every bundle keeps `expansion_variant_budget: null` and the knob is an operator lever. The receipts point at a trigger rather than a weight (expand only when the original query's evidence is weak), filed as the next pre-registered mechanism.

The mode bundles carry an `expansion` value (`tokenmax` true; `balanced` + `conservative` false — off in the cheap tiers because the LLM call adds ~$0.001/query and ~200ms, real money at scale), but the bundle value (and the `search.expansion` config key) only reaches a caller that leaves `expansion` unset AND wires an `expandFn`, and no shipped verb does today. The `query` op defaults `expand: true` per call in every mode (pass `expand: false` / `--no-expand` to opt out) — expansion-by-default is what makes it the concept/landscape verb — while `search`, the memory verbs and the eval harnesses pin expansion per call. `gbrain search modes` reports the bundle value, not what `query` does.

## Putting it together

## Postgres vector-search timeout

`PostgresEngine.searchVector` sets `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '15s'` in
[`src/core/postgres-engine.ts`](../../src/core/postgres-engine.ts). This is a
per-vector-query budget, scoped to its transaction, so it cannot alter other
queries using the shared pool. It was raised from 8 seconds on 2026-07-19 after
a 2,000-dimension, 445 MB HNSW index on a NAS-hosted database exceeded the
previous limit during a cold-cache read. Keyword search deliberately remains at
8 seconds because its indexed path was measured in milliseconds; a larger limit
there would hide a query-plan regression.

Change this value only when a measured vector index read approaches the limit;
verify with the affected `gbrain query --source <id> ...` command both after a
cold start and when warm.

The full pipeline for a trusted local `query` op follows. Remote retrieval
omits the optional code-graph augmentation stage; the policy-filtered typed-edge
relational recall arm remains available.

```

Per-arm fail-open has one deliberate exception: when BOTH lexical arms
(`searchKeyword` + `searchTitles`) come back empty because of an ACCESS-class
failure (`isDbAccessFailure` in `src/core/pg-access-classify.ts` — the DB
itself is unreachable, not a schema gap), `hybridSearch` rethrows the arm
error instead of returning an empty result set. A dead database must surface
as the classified `database_error` envelope, never as a silent "no results".
Schema-class arm failures (pre-migration brains) keep the fail-open contract.

The stage order is pinned by `hybridSearch` in `src/core/search/hybrid.ts`:
dedup runs BEFORE the reranker (so the reranker sees a diverse candidate pool,
capped by its own `topNIn`; the reranker runs only on the full hybrid path — the
no-embedding and keyword-fallback paths are never reranked), the alias hop runs AFTER the reranker (so a query
that is a page's declared name reliably surfaces that page regardless of how
the reranker scored body chunks), and the token budget is enforced last, on
the final slice.

Two cross-cutting seams sit around the pipeline rather than inside it:

- **Private-page visibility.** For untrusted (remote/MCP) callers, every
  recall arm filters `visibility: private` pages via the shared predicate in
  `src/core/search/private-visibility.ts` (fail-closed default; operator
  opt-outs documented in `docs/operations/mcp-surface-runbook.md`). The
  same policy also authorizes contributing pages, link origins, dates and
  annotations before enrichment. Semantic result caching is temporarily
  disabled regardless of configuration; each request performs fresh retrieval.
  Query embeddings can still be reused within that request. Repeated searches
  may have higher latency and provider usage until caching can verify every
  response dependency.
- **CRAG-style confidence gate.** `src/core/search/crag.ts` grades every
  `query` op result (`strong`/`moderate`/`weak`) from the already-stamped
  honesty signals — zero LLM, zero added latency — and attaches the grade to
  response meta. Config-gated and default OFF: `search.crag_escalation=true`
  re-runs a weak retrieval once at a higher ceiling (expansion + relational
  on, autocut off, limit = the caller's explicit `limit` or the mode-derived
  default — never a hardcoded row count — floored at 50) and keeps the
  better-graded run; the re-run fires only when the first pass did not
  already run with the caller's expansion on (`shouldEscalateRetrieval` in
  `crag.ts`), so default-shape callers never pay a second expansion call for
  a near-identical candidate set. `search.crag_think=true` (local callers)
  escalates a still-weak result to `think`.

### Relational re-pin: edge answers bypass reranker demotion

The cross-encoder scores chunk TEXT against the query. The relational arm's
rows are typed-EDGE answers — "who invested in acme-co" resolves to investor
pages whose text need not mention acme-co at all — so a reranker ranks them
below any page that merely contains the query's words. Measured on
NamedThingBench's relational fixture (39 graph-relationship questions, the
shipped `balanced` default, `voyage:rerank-2.5`,
`scripts/r1-namedthing-rerank-ab.ts --relational`, paired per query): with
the reranker on and no pin, hit@1 fell from 21/39 to 3/39 (19 paired losses)
and hit@3 from 27/39 to 5/39 (22 paired losses), while the 11 non-relational
core questions showed 0 losses. With the pin at its default 3 — measured with
`--autocut on`, the shape that shipped before rule R2 turned autocut off — the
same paired comparison shows 0 hit@1 and
0 hit@3 losses (21/39 and 27/39, the reranker-off numbers) and the 11 core
questions unchanged, which is why the balanced reranker stays on.
`pinRelationalRows`
(`src/core/search/relational-rerank-pin.ts`) runs immediately after the
reranker and re-pins the arm's rows above the reranked text rows in their fused
order, bounded by `search.relational_rerank_pin` (3 in every bundle; `0`/`off`
restores the pre-pin ranking). It is a permutation of the pool (nothing added
or removed; one row per page; a relational row the reranker itself ranked
higher keeps that position; ties go to the fused order), fires only when the
reranker actually reordered (fail-open and reranker-off runs are untouched —
the fused order already carries the arm), and is a pure no-op for
non-relational queries. Pinned rows are stamped `relational_pinned` so autocut
keeps them and leaves them out of its cliff math (text-row autocut is
unchanged). The #3995 evidence slot still runs afterwards as the page-1
guarantee for pin 0 / fail-open runs. The pin trusts the arm: a false-positive
arm now puts up to `max` edge pages at the top instead of one at `limit` —
turn it off per brain with `gbrain config set search.relational_rerank_pin off`.
The knob folds into the query-cache key (`rrp=`).

### Metadata boost gate: vector-only voters keep the vector order

The post-fusion metadata boosts (backlink, salience, recency + chronicle,
graph signals, alias resolution) reward well-connected pages. That is right
when a lexical arm agreed the page is about the query; it is wrong on
paraphrase-style concept questions where nothing but the vector arm voted —
there the boosts promoted hub pages (1.03–1.12x) over the gold concept page,
which carried none. `decideMetadataBoosts`
(`src/core/search/metadata-boost-gate.ts`) runs before `runPostFusionStages`
and, under `search.metadata_boost_gate=lexical` (every bundle), skips those
boosts when no strict keyword, title-phrase or relational row fused (relaxed
OR-fallback rows do not count). Supersede downrank, exact-match boost,
title-phrase boost, compiled-truth boost, cosine re-score, dedup, reranker
and autocut are untouched either way. Receipt (Cat 13 conceptual recall,
gbrain-evals): held-out nDCG@5 53.0 → 57.8 (bare vector 60.5 remains the
stretch), NamedThingBench, BrainBench, the retrieval canary and the
LongMemEval dev slice byte-identical. `always` restores the pre-wave
pipeline; the decision is on `HybridSearchMeta.metadata_boost_gate`; the
knob folds into the query-cache key (`mbg=`). The companion
`search.keyword_arm_confidence_floor` (`src/core/search/arm-confidence.ts`,
off in every bundle) down-weights a weak keyword arm in the fusion; its
pre-registered receipt did not move the held-out score, so it ships as an
operator knob only.

### Autocut: score-discontinuity result-sizing

Off by default in every bundle. It shipped on for `balanced` and `tokenmax`
until the ranker wave's pre-registered rule R2 measured it on LongMemEval from
the shipped default's captured post-rerank pool: with the reranker on, the
score cliff after the top session is the normal shape on multi-part questions,
and the cut removed the second gold session — strict `recall_all@5` 449/470 →
379/470 (−68 paired on the 430-question decision set), with no floor in the
sweep {0.10 … 0.80} within two questions of "off" on either seeded half
(0.80 still lost 9, all knowledge-update). Any-hit stayed ≥ 99.4% throughout:
autocut keeps the best session and drops the rest, which is a token saving
(mean returned window 3256 → 1633 estimated tokens at 0.35) paid for with the
questions that need more than one session. `gbrain config set search.autocut
true` re-enables it with the knobs below; a session-aware cut (never below k
distinct sessions) is the filed follow-up. `applyAutocut`
(`src/core/search/autocut.ts`) cuts the ranked set at the largest
cross-encoder rerank-score cliff, before the limit slice, first page only.
Never-empty failsafe (`minKeep`), no-op when fewer than 2 results carry a
finite rerank score (covers the fail-open reranker path), and alias-hop exact
matches are preserved through the cut. Weak-top floor: when the top rerank
score is below `minTopScore` (default 0.35, config `search.autocut_min_top`),
cliff trimming is skipped entirely — a low-confidence list returns the full
cluster for the caller to judge instead of collapsing to one result. Knobs:
per-call `SearchOpts.autocut` → `search.autocut` / `search.autocut_jump` /
`search.autocut_min_top` config → mode bundle. The pre-autocut pool can be
captured for offline floor replay: `hybridSearch` exposes an eval-only
`onRerankPool` hook that fires with the exact pool `applyAutocut` is about to
cut (post-rerank, post alias-hop / exact-lookup, unscored injections included),
`gbrain eval longmemeval --capture-pool` records it per row as `rerank_pool`,
and `scripts/replay-autocut-floor.ts` replays every floor — including `off` —
from that single capture, validating byte-for-byte against the live decisions
before any other cell is read.

Each stage is testable in isolation. Each stage is replaceable. The whole pipeline is < 1ms of orchestration cost; the latency budget goes to the upstream HTTP calls (embedding, rerank) and the index scans.

## How to verify on your own brain

```bash
# Reproduce the public LongMemEval receipt (cleaned S split, k=5) like-for-like:
# --by-type prints strict recall_all@5 (headline) and recall_any@5 (diagnostic);
# the like-for-like row pins the reranker and autocut off.
gbrain eval longmemeval ~/datasets/longmemeval/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json \
  --retrieval-only --top-k 5 --by-type --no-trajectory --mode balanced --reranker off --autocut off
# The shipped default path (what balanced/tokenmax run): --reranker on --autocut off

# Capture your own queries and replay against retrieval changes
export GBRAIN_CONTRIBUTOR_MODE=1
# ... use gbrain normally ...
gbrain eval export > before.ndjson
# ... change something ...
gbrain eval replay --against before.ndjson

# A/B retrieval strategies on a labeled fixture
gbrain eval --qrels labels.tsv --config balanced.json
```

The current measured LongMemEval result (95.53% session-level `recall_all@5` on the release default path, 449/470, and 93.40% with the reranker off, 439/470; cleaned S split, 470 scored questions, k=5, measured 2026-09-06 by the in-repo harness), its per-type table, every arm of the ranker wave and the judged answer-accuracy row live in [`docs/eval-bench.md`](../eval-bench.md#public-benchmarks-longmemeval).

## Restricted salience

Remote reads default to the `world` take holder when no grant is supplied; an
explicit empty grant permits no takes. Counts and average weights use only
permitted active takes. Stored emotional weight contributes zero because it
combines all holders. Recent-salience inclusion uses `updated_at`, while the
existing recency formula is retained; unrestricted local reads keep their
existing formulas. Deleted, quarantined and archived contributors are excluded
before ranking, limits and anomaly-baseline aggregation. Default remote page
privacy also excludes private pages; its documented opt-outs do not widen

## Chunk rebuilds after upgrading

Markdown chunk creation applies the strict protected-body sanitizer before
splitting text. For remote reads, all existing chunks are withheld until a
successful rebuild records the current chunker version. Public pages require
this rebuild too; trusted local chunk reads remain available. Body or chunk changes
invalidate that record until the next successful rebuild. While pages are withheld,
remote `search` / `query` report `degraded: [safe_index_pending]` (the MCP
empty-result block names it) instead of a clean miss, and `gbrain doctor` counts
the withheld pages and points at the `gbrain reindex --markdown` fix. Direct page reads
continue to use current source and visibility policy plus body sanitization.

Run rebuild commands from a local installation on the brain host; thin clients
cannot rebuild the host's indexes.
`gbrain reindex --markdown --dry-run --no-embed` previews the existing rebuild.
`gbrain reindex --markdown --no-embed` rebuilds without embedding calls, replacing
previous vectors; use `gbrain embed --stale` later to restore semantic retrieval
when provider usage is authorized. The regular reindex path rebuilds and embeds.
Code pages use `gbrain reindex-code --force --no-embed`. Existing image indexes
require reimporting the source files; images whose OCR contains protected
sections remain unavailable to remote chunk retrieval. No schema migration is
required.


Optional code-graph expansion is omitted from remote search. The six dedicated
code-inspection operations are also temporarily local-only; see the
[MCP surface runbook](../operations/mcp-surface-runbook.md#temporary-code-inspection-availability).
These restrictions are separate from the chunk rebuild requirement.
