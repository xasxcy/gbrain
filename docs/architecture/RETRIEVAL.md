# Why the hybrid + graph stack works

Vector search alone underdelivers on real personal-knowledge queries. This doc explains why gbrain layers four strategies together and how they compound.

## The four strategies in concert

1. **Vector (HNSW on pgvector)** — semantic similarity. Catches "who works on retrieval quality at acme-example?" → pages mentioning "alice-example + retrieval" even when the user never typed "acme".
2. **BM25 keyword** — lexical match. Catches names, exact phrases, code identifiers, anything where the user remembers the literal token. Survives the cases where vector search drifts into thematic neighbors.
3. **Reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF)** — merges vector + keyword rankings without weighting one over the other globally. Each strategy gets to vote.
4. **Knowledge graph traversal** — follows typed edges. Catches "what did Bob invest in this quarter?" by walking `bob ── invested_in ──> company ── dated ──> Q1`. Vector search can't see causal chains; the graph can.

## Why each one alone fails

**Vector only.** Returns chunks semantically close to the query. Misses any factual relationship not directly encoded in the embedding. "Companies in alice-example's portfolio" returns essays about portfolios, not company pages.

**Keyword only (ripgrep-style).** Brittle to phrasing. "Who works on retrieval?" misses pages that say "search ranking" instead of "retrieval." Garbage on synonyms, near-misses, or paraphrases.

**Graph only.** Excellent at "neighbors of Alice" but blind to anything not yet linked. Sparse on fresh pages until backlinks accumulate.

**Hybrid (vector + keyword + RRF), no graph.** Decent at "what is X?" type queries. Fails on "what is Y's relationship to X?" — those are graph queries and no amount of embedding tuning recovers them.

## The benchmark

BrainBench (corpus + harness in the sibling [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) repo) measures retrieval P@5, R@5, MRR, nDCG@5 on a 240-page Opus-generated rich-prose corpus. (This is the retrieval-ranking benchmark; the in-repo `gbrain eval brainbench` suite — [`docs/eval/BRAINBENCH.md`](../eval/BRAINBENCH.md) — gates the memory behaviors *above* retrieval: unprompted context push, write-back fidelity, cross-session continuity.)

| Strategy | P@5 | R@5 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ripgrep BM25 only | ~18 | ~75 | Lexical-only baseline |
| vector-only RAG | ~18 | ~80 | Standard RAG implementation |
| gbrain graph-disabled (hybrid + RRF, no graph traversal) | ~18 | ~85 | Hybrid alone |
| **gbrain default (full stack)** | **49.1** | **97.9** | Graph + extract-quality lift |

**+31 P@5 points** from the graph + extract quality work. The graph isn't a marginal feature; it's the load-bearing wall.

## Auto-link: why zero-LLM-call edge extraction works

Every `put_page` runs `extractEntityRefs` on the markdown body. It matches:

- Standard markdown links: `[Alice Example](wiki/people/alice-example)`
- Obsidian wikilinks: `[[wiki/people/alice-example|Alice Example]]`
- Typed-link blockquotes: `> **Convention:** see [path](path).`

Three regexes, zero LLM tokens, single SQL `addLinksBatch` call with `INSERT ... SELECT FROM jsonb_to_recordset(($1::jsonb)->'rows') JOIN pages ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING 1` (free-text-safe; the prior `unnest(${arr}::text[])` form crashed on calendar/Zoom context per gbrain#1861). The graph grows on every write at near-zero cost. On a 17K-page brain, full graph extract completes in seconds.

Heuristic link-type inference (`attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`) fires from surrounding sentence context — also LLM-free. Power users who want richer types add them via the typed-link blockquote convention.

## Cross-encoder reranker: 60% top-1 reshuffle

The reranker is on for the `balanced` and `tokenmax` mode bundles, off for `conservative`. New installs with a Voyage key get `rerank-2.5` written as explicit `search.reranker.model` config (the recommended reranker; same `VOYAGE_API_KEY` as embeddings — keyed installs without one get reranking explicitly disabled instead); brains that never set the key still fall back to the legacy ZeroEntropy `zerank-2` mode-bundle default, which is deprecated (the hosted API ends 2026-09-04 — switch with `gbrain config set search.reranker.model voyage:rerank-2.5`) and remains the fallback only until the September cutover. On a real-corpus benchmark across 20 queries, zerank-2 reshuffles **60% of top-1 results** after the hybrid + RRF + graph stack. That's the headline number.

The mechanical reason: hybrid ranking is locally optimal per strategy but globally suboptimal. A cross-encoder reranker reads the query + each candidate document jointly, with full attention. It catches the cases where the vector + keyword + graph signals all agreed on a document that's semantically related but topically wrong.

The cost: +150ms p50 latency, ~$0.025–0.05/M tokens depending on the reranker. Disabled with `gbrain config set search.reranker.enabled false`. For agent loops that do downstream LLM work after retrieval, the latency is invisible.

## Source-aware ranking

Hybrid search applies a source-factor CASE expression at the SQL layer (lives in `src/core/search/sql-ranking.ts`). Curated content like `originals/`, `concepts/`, `writing/` outranks bulk content like `your-openclaw/chat/`, `daily/`, `media/x/`. Hard-exclude prefixes (`test/`, `attachments/`, `.raw/`) filter at retrieval, not post-rank.

`archive/` is deliberately NOT hard-excluded (issue #1777): it holds high-signal historical content users expect to find, so it is demoted (`0.5x` in `DEFAULT_SOURCE_BOOSTS`), not hidden. The demote is a prior applied in the outer SQL re-rank; the cross-encoder reranker (balanced/tokenmax modes) can still PROMOTE an archive page that survives the demote into the rerank candidate window — it is not an unconditional suppression. `gbrain doctor`'s `hidden_by_search_policy` check reports how many chunked pages remain hidden by the surviving exclude prefixes.

The boost map is configurable via `GBRAIN_SOURCE_BOOST` env var or per-call `SearchOpts.exclude_slug_prefixes`. Temporal queries (`detail: 'high'`) bypass the boost so chat pages re-surface for time-sensitive lookups.

## Named-thing retrieval (per-page pool + title + alias + evidence)

A brain organized around *chosen names* (project codenames, place nicknames —
say a project named "Helios" whose page is also known as "the Sun Room") needs
more than embedding proximity. Four layers, added after the incident in
[`RETRIEVAL_MAXPOOL_INCIDENT.md`](./RETRIEVAL_MAXPOOL_INCIDENT.md):

- **Per-page max-pool** — `searchVector` (both engines) collapses chunk-grain
  candidates to the best chunk per page (`DISTINCT ON (slug)`) over the full
  candidate set before the user `LIMIT`, via the shared `buildBestPerPagePoolCte`
  in `sql-ranking.ts`. The vector side returns N distinct pages by best chunk,
  not N chunks that collapse to fewer pages downstream. When one dense page's
  chunks fill the inner candidate pool, the engines escalate the pool in a
  bounded loop (×4 per step, at most 3 escalations; HNSW-backed columns
  additionally cap at the `ef_search` ceiling) until the page count is honest;
  a loop that ends still underfilled surfaces `vector_pool_underfilled` on the
  hybrid layer's `HybridSearchMeta` (the op-layer capture channel) instead of
  silently returning a short page.
- **Title-phrase boost** — when the normalized query is a contiguous token-run
  inside `page.title` (or an exact full-title match), a floor-ratio-gated,
  bounded multiplier fires (`applyTitleBoost`, `search.title_boost` knob). A
  query that is a phrase from the title can't lose to a body chunk by luck.
- **Alias hop** — free-text `aliases:` frontmatter is projected into a
  `page_aliases` table (separate from the `slug_aliases` wikilink redirect) and
  consulted at query time: a full normalized-query match injects/boosts the
  canonical page (`applyAliasHop`). The only layer that bridges true synonyms
  with zero surface overlap ("the Sun Room" → the Helios page). Backfill
  existing pages with `gbrain reindex --aliases`.
- **Evidence contract** — every result carries `evidence`
  (`alias_hit | exact_title_match | high_vector_match | keyword_exact |
  weak_semantic`) and `create_safety` (`exists | probable | unknown`). An agent
  deciding "is this page already here, safe to NOT write a duplicate?" keys off
  `create_safety`, not a raw blended score. `high_vector_match` is grounded in
  the result's real query↔chunk cosine (`SearchResult.cosine` at/above
  `search.evidence_cosine_floor`, default 0.80) — never the blended score, so a
  keyword+boost pile-up can't read as semantic support; keyless runs have no
  cosine and degrade to honest keyword-based labels. `gbrain search --explain`
  prints each result's raw cosine next to its blended score.

**Extraction quarantine lane (issue #160):** pages carrying the unverified
auto-extracted markers (frontmatter `provenance: auto-extracted` +
`status: unverified`, see `src/core/extraction-review.ts`) rank as ordinary
content — they are skipped by the compiled-truth fusion boost and by the
`people/`/`companies/` namespace source-boost, and every search result from
such a page carries `unverified: true` so agents can label the provenance.
Promote or reject them via `gbrain extraction-pending` / `gbrain
extraction-review`.

The `search` MCP/CLI op is **cheap-hybrid** (vector + keyword + RRF + pool +
title + alias, expansion off); `query` is the full-control variant. Route
concept / landscape / "all-of-X" questions to `query` — expansion recovers
synonym-phrased matches `search` can miss, and a populated `search` result set
is not proof of coverage (both are top-K; exhaustive enumeration belongs to
`list_pages`). NamedThingBench
(`gbrain eval retrieval-quality`) gates these families on every PR. Diagnose a
specific miss with `gbrain search diagnose "<q>" --target <slug>`.

## Intent-aware query rewriting

`src/core/search/query-intent.ts` classifies queries into `entity`, `temporal`, `event`, `concept`, or `general`. Each routes through different ranking knobs:

- **Entity** queries ("who works at X?") apply a higher graph-traversal weight.
- **Temporal** queries ("what happened last week?") bypass source-boost so chat/daily pages surface.
- **Event** queries ("Acme AI Series A") engage the timeline index.
- **Concept** queries ("what is the ownership economy?", "find all the companies doing offshore wind" — definitional paraphrases and landscape/quantifier phrasings with no proper noun) rank vector-lean, so keyword-decoy pages stop outranking the page that actually explains the idea. Proper nouns, quoted phrases, and sub-3-word queries never classify as concept — they keep their existing routing.
- **General** queries hit the standard hybrid stack.

The classifier is deterministic (no LLM call). Wrong classification degrades gracefully — the hybrid stack still works without it.

## Multi-query expansion

For `detail: 'high'` searches, `src/core/search/expansion.ts` runs a Haiku-class LLM call to produce 2-3 query variants. Each variant runs through the full hybrid stack; results merge via RRF. Catches synonym misses without recall loss.

Expansion is opt-in per mode bundle (`tokenmax` on by default; `balanced` + `conservative` off). Default off in the cheap tiers because the LLM call adds ~$0.001/query and ~200ms — real money at scale. The `query` op is the exception: it defaults `expand: true` per call (pass `expand: false` to opt out) — expansion-by-default is what makes it the concept/landscape verb.

## Putting it together

## Postgres vector-search timeout

`PostgresEngine.searchVector` sets `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '15s'` in
[`src/core/postgres-engine.ts`](../../src/core/postgres-engine.ts). This is a
per-vector-query budget, scoped to its transaction, so it cannot alter other
queries using the shared pool. It was raised from 8 seconds on 2026-07-19 after
a 2,000-dimension, 445 MB HNSW index on a NAS-hosted database exceeded the
previous limit during a cold-cache read. Keyword search deliberately remains at
8 seconds because its indexed path was measured in milliseconds; a larger limit
there would hide a query-plan regression.

Change this value only when a measured vector index read approaches the limit;
verify with the affected `gbrain query --source <id> ...` command both after a
cold start and when warm.

The full pipeline for a `query` op:

```
intent classify (query-intent.ts — deterministic, no LLM)
       │
       ▼
expansion (if enabled — tokenmax only by default)
       │
       ▼
hybrid recall + fusion:
   ├── vector  (HNSW on chunk embeddings, per-page max-pool)
   ├── keyword (BM25 via tsvector)
   ├── title-phrase arm
   ├── relational (typed-edge recall arm — relational queries only)
   ├── source-aware re-rank (CASE in SQL)
   └── RRF fusion → cosine re-score → post-fusion boosts
       (backlink / salience / recency / graph signals / exact-match)
       │
       ▼
graph augment (optional two-pass structural expansion — walkDepth > 0)
       │
       ▼
deduplication (4-layer: per-page cap, same-page Jaccard, type diversity)
       │
       ▼
reranker (cross-encoder — balanced/tokenmax; fail-open)
       │
       ▼
alias hop (exact alias match injects/boosts the canonical page)
       │
       ▼
exact-lookup tier (lookup-shaped queries only: slug + exact-title probes
   promote/inject the identity page at rank-1; supersession-filtered;
   fail-open — src/core/search/exact-lookup.ts)
       │
       ▼
evidence stamp → adaptive return (opt-in) → autocut (reranked modes)
       │
       ▼
limit slice → token-budget enforcement (per mode bundle)
       │
       ▼
results (+ retrieval-confidence grade in query-op meta — crag.ts)
```

The stage order is pinned by `hybridSearch` in `src/core/search/hybrid.ts`:
dedup runs BEFORE the reranker (so the reranker sees a diverse candidate pool,
capped by its own `topNIn`), the alias hop runs AFTER the reranker (so a query
that is a page's declared name reliably surfaces that page regardless of how
the reranker scored body chunks), and the token budget is enforced last, on
the final slice.

Two cross-cutting seams sit around the pipeline rather than inside it:

- **Private-page visibility.** For untrusted (remote/MCP) callers, every
  recall arm filters `visibility: private` pages via the shared predicate in
  `src/core/search/private-visibility.ts` (fail-closed default; operator
  opt-outs documented in `docs/operations/mcp-surface-runbook.md`). The
  posture folds into the query-cache key, so trusted and untrusted runs never
  share cache rows.
- **CRAG-style confidence gate.** `src/core/search/crag.ts` grades every
  `query` op result (`strong`/`moderate`/`weak`) from the already-stamped
  honesty signals — zero LLM, zero added latency — and attaches the grade to
  response meta. Config-gated and default OFF: `search.crag_escalation=true`
  re-runs a weak retrieval once at a higher ceiling (expansion + relational +
  wide limit, autocut off) and keeps the better-graded run;
  `search.crag_think=true` (local callers) escalates a still-weak result to
  `think`.

### Autocut: score-discontinuity result-sizing

Default-on for `balanced` and `tokenmax` (off for `conservative`, which has no
reranker and therefore no trustworthy cliff signal). `applyAutocut`
(`src/core/search/autocut.ts`) cuts the ranked set at the largest
cross-encoder rerank-score cliff, before the limit slice, first page only.
Never-empty failsafe (`minKeep`), no-op when fewer than 2 results carry a
finite rerank score (covers the fail-open reranker path), and alias-hop exact
matches are preserved through the cut. Weak-top floor: when the top rerank
score is below `minTopScore` (default 0.35, config `search.autocut_min_top`),
cliff trimming is skipped entirely — a low-confidence list returns the full
cluster for the caller to judge instead of collapsing to one result. Knobs:
per-call `SearchOpts.autocut` → `search.autocut` / `search.autocut_jump` /
`search.autocut_min_top` config → mode bundle.

Each stage is testable in isolation. Each stage is replaceable. The whole pipeline is < 1ms of orchestration cost; the latency budget goes to the upstream HTTP calls (embedding, rerank) and the index scans.
