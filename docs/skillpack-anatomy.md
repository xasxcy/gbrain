# Skillpack anatomy

The canonical one-page reference for what a third-party gbrain skillpack
looks like. The reference pack at `examples/skillpack-reference/` is the
live artifact this page describes; clone its tree and you have a 10/10
starting point.

## Tree

`gbrain skillpack init <name>` scaffolds this exact tree, pre-filled
with stubs that score 10/10 on `gbrain skillpack doctor . --quick`
immediately. Replace the stubs with real content, run the doctor
between edits, and `gbrain skillpack pack` produces a deterministic
`<name>-<version>.tgz` ready to publish to the registry.

## How the agent uses a scaffolded pack

After `gbrain skillpack scaffold <source>` lands the files:

1. The user's agent walks `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter and reads
   each pack's `triggers:` array on startup or per-message.
2. When a user phrasing matches a trigger, the agent reads that
   SKILL.md body top-to-bottom as in-context instructions.
3. gbrain DISPLAYS `runbooks/bootstrap.md` once after the scaffold
   but does NOT auto-execute it. The agent decides whether to walk
   the steps. This is the codex T1 supply-chain hardening: an
   auto-walker would let a malicious pack mutate the user's brain
   on install, which is how npm postinstall attacks happen.

## How the doctor scores a pack

Ten binary dimensions. Each is checked by a pure function in
`src/core/skillpack/rubric.ts` and returns `{passed, detail, fix_hint}`.
The doctor walks them in order and prints the score + per-dimension
status + paste-ready fix for every failure.

<!-- BEGIN auto-generated:rubric -->

### Core dimensions (5; must all pass to publish at any tier)

| # | Name | Description | Auto-fixable |
|---|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | `manifest_valid` | skillpack.json passes the v1 schema validator | no |
| 2 | `skills_have_skill_md` | every listed skill has SKILL.md with valid frontmatter (name, description, triggers) | no |
| 3 | `routing_evals_present` | every skill has routing-eval.jsonl with >= 5 intents | yes |
| 4 | `skills_have_unique_triggers` | no two skills in this pack share an exact trigger phrase (MECE) | no |
| 5 | `changelog_present_and_current` | CHANGELOG.md present and contains an entry for the current version | yes |

### Quality badges (5; earn for tier eligibility)

| # | Name | Description | Auto-fixable |
|---|------|-------------|--------------|
| 6 | `unit_tests_present` | pack declares unit_tests[] with at least one matching test file | yes |
| 7 | `e2e_tests_present` | pack declares e2e_tests[] with at least one matching test file | yes |
| 8 | `llm_eval_present` | pack declares llm_evals[] with >= 1 file containing >= 3 cases | yes |
| 9 | `bootstrap_runbook_present` | pack declares runbooks.bootstrap and the file is non-empty | yes |
| 10 | `license_present` | LICENSE file exists at the pack root (informational badge) | yes |

## Tier eligibility

| Tier | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| `endorsed` | All 5 core + all 5 badges, plus Garry's `endorsements.json` overlay in the registry repo |
| `community` | All 5 core + >= 3 of 5 badges. Default tier on PR merge. |
| `experimental` | All 5 core + < 3 badges |
| `blocked` | Any core dimension fails |

## CLI reference (third-party path)

```bash
# Publisher side
gbrain skillpack init my-pack         # scaffold the tree
gbrain skillpack doctor my-pack       # see the score + fix hints
gbrain skillpack doctor my-pack --fix --yes  # auto-scaffold missing pieces
gbrain skillpack pack my-pack         # deterministic tarball + SHA-256

# Consumer side
gbrain skillpack search <query>       # browse the registry
gbrain skillpack info <name>          # show full pack metadata
gbrain skillpack scaffold <source>    # owner/repo, https, ./dir, ./*.tgz
gbrain skillpack registry --url X     # point at a custom registry
```

## Brain-resident packs

A brain/source repo can carry its own publishable skillpack (`brain_resident: true`
in `skillpack.json`, plus a `schema_pack` declaration). Scaffold one with:

```bash
gbrain skillpack init-brain-pack <name>   # inside the brain repo; --dry-run to preview
```

Connecting harnesses discover the pack on `gbrain sources add`, and remote
agents reach it over MCP via the source-scoped `list_brain_skillpack` op +
`get_skill --source_id` (gated by the `mcp.publish_skills` config key). The
anatomy above applies unchanged — a brain-resident pack is a normal pack that
happens to live inside a brain repo.
