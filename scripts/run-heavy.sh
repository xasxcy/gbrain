# Runs every shell script under tests/heavy/ sequentially.
# Sister to scripts/run-slow-tests.sh and scripts/run-e2e.sh, but for
# ops-shape tests that aren't bun:test targets.
#
# Usage:
#   bun run test:heavy                  # all scripts, sequential
#   bash scripts/run-heavy.sh           # same
#   bash scripts/run-heavy.sh <pattern> # only scripts whose basename matches glob
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all scripts passed (or no scripts found — informational)
#   N  exit code of the first failing script

# #3485: the heavy lane runs destructive shell scripts against DATABASE_URL —
# apply the shared name floor once here for every script it dispatches.
