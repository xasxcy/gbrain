# CI guard: fail if any SELECT projection on `pages` that feeds rowToPage()
# drops `source_id`. After v0.32.8, Page.source_id is required at the type
# level; a projection that omits the column makes rowToPage return a Page
# with source_id=undefined, which TypeScript's `: string` then lies about.
#
# This complements the type-system guard. The grep finds the specific 4-tuple
# shape (id, slug, type, title) without source_id — the exact pre-v0.32.8
# pattern that codex's plan review flagged.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-source-id-projection.sh
# Exit:  0 when no matches, 1 when matches found.

# subqueries, COUNT, etc.) These don't feed rowToPage.

# The shape that DOES feed rowToPage starts `SELECT id, ... slug, ... type, ... title`
