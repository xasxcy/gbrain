# v0.36.1.0 (T20 / CDX-14) — privacy CI guard for the synthetic calibration corpus.
#
# Scans test/fixtures/calibration/ for patterns that look like real-world
# specificity. Fails the build if any are found. Closes the synthetic-corpus
# privacy hole flagged by codex review CDX-14: "CC reads real brain pages
# locally, writes nothing still risks privacy if any generated synthetic
# fixture memorizes structure-specific facts. Placeholder names are not enough."
#
# What this catches:
#   - Real dollar amounts (e.g. "$50M", "$1.2B")
#   - Specific large round counts ($X cap is OK; "$50M Series B" is not)
#   - Year-specific date strings outside the 2024-2026 placeholder range
#   - The real founder/company names from the operator's network (looked up
#     from a sibling file scripts/check-synthetic-corpus-allowlist.txt when
#     present; otherwise we just check the placeholder allow-list)
#
# False positives stay safer than false negatives — this guard biases toward
# the operator manually verifying a flagged page is legitimately synthetic.

# BrainBench corpus (evals/brainbench/) — same privacy posture, JSON shape.
# The corpus is GENERATED whole-cloth (evals/brainbench/generator/gen.ts,
# curated synthetic name pools, PRNG scenarios), so string-level checks are a
# backstop for hand-authored spike fixtures + future contributions. The
# scenario-privacy rule (no real deal shapes / timelines, even anonymized)
# lives in evals/brainbench/README.md and is review-enforced.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Env override exists for the negative-path test (test/eval-brainbench-e2e.test.ts)
