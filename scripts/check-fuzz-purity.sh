# CI guard: verify that every fuzz target in `test/fuzz/pure-validators.test.ts`
# is genuinely PURE — no transitive imports of `node:fs`, `node:child_process`,
# the engine layer, or `node:net` / `node:http` / `node:https`.
#
# Mechanism: bundle each target file with `bun build --target=bun` (which
# resolves the full transitive import graph) then grep the bundle for forbidden
# imports. Bun surfaces transitively-imported node builtins in the bundle output
# even when the indirect-importing file is only reached through several layers,
# so the grep catches what require.cache / source-grep approaches miss. This is
# the "isolated Bun subprocess with import-trace probe" design from the T2
# plan revision.
#
# Smoke-tested 2026-05-19: adding `import { lstatSync } from 'node:fs'` to a
# target file makes this script fail loudly with the offending file + matched
# pattern.
#
# Failure modes the guard catches:
#   - Direct import of a banned builtin in a target file
#   - Transitive import through a helper (the failure mode my v1 require.cache
#     proposal couldn't catch in Bun's ESM loader)
#   - Re-export from a barrel module
#
# What this DOESN'T catch:
#   - Runtime-only `require('fs')` constructed via string concatenation
#     (intentional escape hatch is rare and would surface in code review)
#   - Native addon dynamic imports
#
# Usage: scripts/check-fuzz-purity.sh
# Exit:  0 = all targets pure, 1 = any target imports a banned module.

# Targets — keep in sync with `test/fuzz/pure-validators.test.ts` imports.
# Only files whose bundle is bundle-pure live here. The original T2 plan listed
# more files; the bundle disproved their purity (validator-shaped functions
# living in modules that transitively import fs). Those validators still get
# property-tested in `test/fuzz/mixed-validators.test.ts` — same fuzz coverage,
# no purity guarantee. Filesystem-touching validators live in
# `test/fuzz/filesystem-validators.test.ts`.

# Banned imports. Bun's bundler emits a mix of forms in the output JS:
#   - `from "fs"` / `from "node:fs"` (named + namespace imports preserve this)
#   - `__require("fs")` / `require("fs")` (CJS-style or dynamic-import lowering)
#   - `from "fs/promises"` / `from "node:fs/promises"` (subpaths — promises API)
#   - `import("fs")` (raw dynamic import that may survive bundling)
# /review codex pass caught the subpath + dynamic-import gaps; this list closes
# them. Subpath patterns use trailing-slash matches so `fs/promises` and any
# future `fs/<subpath>` all trip the guard.
